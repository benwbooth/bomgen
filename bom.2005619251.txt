Alma 25:20
 20 And now, my beloved brethren, I have somewhat to say unto you concerning the
coming of our first king. Behold, I say unto you, that the day
soon cometh that he shall be established over our land; yea,
and he shall rule over our land forever; for he is a
lord over us all, and we are his slaves.

Alma 25:21
 21 And now it came to pass that when Ammon had made an end of
speaking unto the people
 concerning the coming of the first king over the land of
Nephi, there arose a great contention among them concerning the
coming of the first king over the land of the people.

Alma 25:22
 22 And it came to pass that they did seek to overthrow him by
all the means which they could lay their hands upon him; for
they did cast lots among themselves, that he might not be established
over the land; therefore he was brought down to the land of
Nephi.

Alma 25:23
 23 Now it came to pass that Ammon and his brethren, being
wary of the people proceeding forth with their heads bowed,
being a remnant of the people of the Lamanites, therefore they
returned again to the land of Zarahemla, and were desirous to know of the
people whether they should be a part of the clan of Amulon.

Alma 25:24
 24 And now behold, this was the case with all the
people, every one in his own tribe, every man to his own
king; and they did answer him, saying, Nay, we are not a part of the
cranes.

Alma 25:25
 25 Now Ammon and his brethren did not believe these words, for
they had heard the words of the Lord; for behold, the Lord
had said unto them that they should repent, and come unto him in
the wilderness, and be baptized--

Alma 25:26
 26 And then, O then, would we believe this? And they said: We are a
tradition of the Lamanites, and we have no king; our wives and our
children would not that we should be a part of their clan.

Alma 25:27
 27 But, behold, Ammon and his brethren and all the people
who had answered the words of the Lord were baptized in the waters
of Mormon.

Alma 25:28
 28 And thus it came to pass that after this manner were the
people of Ammon, who were a remnant of the people of the
Lamanites; and thus they were brought back unto the land of
Nephi, and were settled in the land, even until the
nation was destroyed from off the face of the land.

Alma 25:29
 29 And it came to pass that Ammon, being a man of pure
reason, therefore he sought to know of the fathers of the people of
Nephi; and he also inquired of the Lord concerning that
which he should do in the case of the Lamanites.

Alma 25:30
 30 And it came to pass that the Lord showed unto him all things
concerning the matter; for he said unto him: Go forth and
be baptized in the waters of Mormon, repentance and righteousness
preserved, until the time shall come that the power of the
Lamanites shall be destroyed from off the face of the land.

Alma 25:31
 31 Therefore, when that day shall come, and the Lamanites shall
be destroyed from off the face of the land, behold, I will proceed
with the records which I have made unto my people, which are upon
the plates of brass; and I will show unto them all things which have
been done upon the plates of brass.

Alma 25:32
 32 And it came to pass that Ammon did this, and sent forth
the plates of brass forth upon the people, showing unto them all
concerning the presidency of the government, from the time that Lehi
left Jerusalem until the time that he returned.

Alma 25:33
 33 And he also showed unto them all the records which were
engraven upon the plates of brass, both those which were handed down
by the kings and priests of the people, which were pertaining unto the
presidency of the kings and those that served them, and also
those which were not.

Alma 25:34
 34 And it came to pass that this Ammon, being a man of pure
reason, therefore he did inquire of the Lord concerning his
father, and his people.

Alma 25:35
 35 And it came to pass that the Lordin the waters
of Mormon.

Alma 25:28
 28 And thus it came to pass that after this manner were the
people of Ammon, who were a remnant of the people of the
Lamanites; and thus they were brought back unto the land of
Nephi, and were settled in the land, even until the
nation was destroyed from off the face of the land.

Alma 25:29
 29 And it came to pass that Ammon, being a man of pure
reason, therefore he sought to know of the fathers of the people of
Nephi; and he also inquired of the Lord concerning that
which he should do in the case of the Lamanites.

Alma 25:30
 30 And it came to pass that the Lord showed unto him all things
concerning the matter; for he said unto him: Go forth and
be baptized in the waters of Mormon, repentance and righteousness
preserved, until the time shall come that the power of the
Lamanites shall be destroyed from off the face of the land.

Alma 25:31
 31 Therefore, when that day shall come, and the Lamanites shall
be destroyed from off the face of the land, behold, I will proceed
with the records which I have made unto my people, which are upon
the plates of brass; and I will show unto them all things which have
been done upon the plates of brass.

Alma 25:32
 32 And it came to pass that Ammon did this, and sent forth
the plates of brass forth upon the people, showing unto them all
concerning the presidency of the government, from the time that Lehi
left Jerusalem until the time that he returned.

Alma 25:33
 33 And he also showed unto them all the records which were
engraven upon the plates of brass, both those which were handed down
by the kings and priests of the people, which were pertaining unto the
presidency of the kings and those that served them, and also
those which were not.

Alma 25:34
 34 And it came to pass that this Ammon, being a man of pure
reason, therefore he did inquire of the Lord concerning his
father, and his people.

Alma 25:35
 35 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto him: Go forth
and be baptized in the waters of Mormon, repentance and righteousness
preserved, until the time shall come that thou shalt no more
be a man of wicked before the Lord thy God.

Alma 25:36
 36 Yea, until thou shalt repent and return unto me, I will show unto
you the records which are engraven upon the plates of brass,
which are not upon the plates of Nephi.

Alma 25:37
 37 And I will show unto thee, that thou shalt not have these
records any more; for I in my wisdom know that thou shalt not have
these records; for I know that thou shalt not have them; for I
know that thou shalt not have them.

Alma 25:38
 38 Behold, I know that thou shalt not have them; for I know that if I
should show thee another record, that thou wouldst judge me not.
And thus it is; and thus it is. Amen.

Alma 26
Chapter 26

Alma 26:1
 1 Now it came to pass that while Ammon was thus speaking with
the father of Amalickiah, he also inquired of the Lord concerning the
record which had been handed down by the priests of the people,
concerning the time and the place of the gathering of the people together
in the wilderness.

Alma 26:2
 2 And the Lord said unto him: Behold, I know that thou art Ammon, and
behold that I know that thou hast been a just man before the
judgment-seat of the son of Amalickiah: for I have seen thy
luminous countenance, and I have also heard thy voice; and I know that
thou art a just man; therefore, thou shalt not have these things
concerning the record.

Alma 26:3
 3 Now it came to pass that the Lord commanded Ammon that he
should not tell this thing unto the people at Jerusalem;
but that he should write it in the book which was brought
forth by the finger of Nephi; for this purpose he showed himself
unto him.

Alma 26:4
 4 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made an end of
speaking with the father of Amalickiah, behold, the Lord spake unto
him, saying: I know that thou shalt not suffer these things
 said unto him: Go forth
and be baptized in the waters of Mormon, repentance and righteousness
preserved, until the time shall come that thou shalt no more
be a man of wicked before the Lord thy God.

Alma 25:36
 36 Yea, until thou shalt repent and return unto me, I will show unto
you the records which are engraven upon the plates of brass,
which are not upon the plates of Nephi.

Alma 25:37
 37 And I will show unto thee, that thou shalt not have these
records any more; for I in my wisdom know that thou shalt not have
these records; for I know that thou shalt not have them; for I
know that thou shalt not have them.

Alma 25:38
 38 Behold, I know that thou shalt not have them; for I know that if I
should show thee another record, that thou wouldst judge me not.
And thus it is; and thus it is. Amen.

Alma 26
Chapter 26

Alma 26:1
 1 Now it came to pass that while Ammon was thus speaking with
the father of Amalickiah, he also inquired of the Lord concerning the
record which had been handed down by the priests of the people,
concerning the time and the place of the gathering of the people together
in the wilderness.

Alma 26:2
 2 And the Lord said unto him: Behold, I know that thou art Ammon, and
behold that I know that thou hast been a just man before the
judgment-seat of the son of Amalickiah: for I have seen thy
luminous countenance, and I have also heard thy voice; and I know that
thou art a just man; therefore, thou shalt not have these things
concerning the record.

Alma 26:3
 3 Now it came to pass that the Lord commanded Ammon that he
should not tell this thing unto the people at Jerusalem;
but that he should write it in the book which was brought
forth by the finger of Nephi; for this purpose he showed himself
unto him.

Alma 26:4
 4 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made an end of
speaking with the father of Amalickiah, behold, the Lord spake unto
him, saying: I know that thou shalt not suffer these things
to remain in my possession; therefore I command thee that thou
spake not more concerning them unto the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:5
 5 But that at Jerusalem I would release the records, which are
in the book, which belong to me. But this I command thee,
that thou shalt not destroy; but I will gather them together in
the book which is brought forth by the finger of Nephi, and
shall make them known unto the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:6
 6 Now Ammon did as he was commanded; and he wrote the remainder
of the record which he had written in the book which he
had brought forth by the finger of Nephi.

Alma 26:7
 7 And he laid it before the people at Jerusalem;
but he said unto them: Behold, these are the plates of brass,
which contain the records of our fathers.

Alma 26:8
 8 Now it came to pass that when of the interpreters there should
be found any records which did not correspond with the plates of
brass, these would be destroyed; for there could no man
reconstruct them; therefore, the plates of brass must needs
have remained in the earth.

Alma 26:9
 9 But, behold, they have become precious; and now behold, the Lord
commands me that I should preserve them, that I may preserve these
translations unto my people.

Alma 26:10
 10 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded,
and wrote the remainder of the record which he had translated; and he
carried them forth unto the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:11
 11 And it came to pass that the people at Jerusalem did rejoice
over the record which they had received, which contained the
translations of the records of the prophets, which had been handed
down from generation to generation.

Alma 26:12
 12 And now I do not write all the things which are written in the
record which Ammon translated; but I do write the things
which I have translated; for I know that the Lord God will
write them; for they are the records which have been handed
down from the father, from generation to generation.

Alma 26:13
 13 And I do not write theerefore I command thee that thou
spake not more concerning them unto the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:5
 5 But that at Jerusalem I would release the records, which are
in the book, which belong to me. But this I command thee,
that thou shalt not destroy; but I will gather them together in
the book which is brought forth by the finger of Nephi, and
shall make them known unto the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:6
 6 Now Ammon did as he was commanded; and he wrote the remainder
of the record which he had written in the book which he
had brought forth by the finger of Nephi.

Alma 26:7
 7 And he laid it before the people at Jerusalem;
but he said unto them: Behold, these are the plates of brass,
which contain the records of our fathers.

Alma 26:8
 8 Now it came to pass that when of the interpreters there should
be found any records which did not correspond with the plates of
brass, these would be destroyed; for there could no man
reconstruct them; therefore, the plates of brass must needs
have remained in the earth.

Alma 26:9
 9 But, behold, they have become precious; and now behold, the Lord
commands me that I should preserve them, that I may preserve these
translations unto my people.

Alma 26:10
 10 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded,
and wrote the remainder of the record which he had translated; and he
carried them forth unto the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:11
 11 And it came to pass that the people at Jerusalem did rejoice
over the record which they had received, which contained the
translations of the records of the prophets, which had been handed
down from generation to generation.

Alma 26:12
 12 And now I do not write all the things which are written in the
record which Ammon translated; but I do write the things
which I have translated; for I know that the Lord God will
write them; for they are the records which have been handed
down from the father, from generation to generation.

Alma 26:13
 13 And I do not write the things which I write, but the Lord
God will write them; and he will show unto me concerning the
wickedness of the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:14
 14 And now I read unto you, that when the record of the
prophets shall be fulfilled, and also the record of the
translators, behold, many of them shall be destroyed; for behold,
the Lord has shown unto me that they have transfigured the
record, that I should translate them.

Alma 26:15
 15 And now I ask, and shall be answered: What have ye done,
that I should be commanded that I should translate these things?
Behold, I have not, for I do not know the things whereof I
am commanded.

Alma 26:16
 16 And it came to pass that when Ammon had finished
these words, the people did marvel again at his wickedness;
nevertheless, they did not lay their eyes upon the plates of
brass which he had transfigured;

Alma 26:17
 17 But they began to pray unto the Lord that he would show unto them the
things which had been translated, and also the things which
were not translated.

Alma 26:18
 18 And it came to pass that when they had all finished
these words, and were praying, they were troubled because of the
evil of Ammon, yea, even that he should be cast out of the
wilderness; and this because of the things which he had transfigured
in them.

Alma 26:19
 19 And it came to pass that they did again inquire of the Lord,
saying: What meaneth this thing which we have all been commanded
to translate? And he said unto them: Read ye this, until ye shall
believe on his name.

Alma 26:20
 20 And they did as the Lord commanded them; and they began to
read the records which had been brought by the people of Nephi out
of the land of Jerusalem; and thus they did read the records
of the people of the Jews, until they had read the words which had
been commanded them.

Alma 26:21
 21 And now it came to pass that when they had all read these
things, they were troubled also with him that he should
not be found, for they did not believe that he could be
murdered.

Alma 26:rite, but the Lord
God will write them; and he will show unto me concerning the
wickedness of the people at Jerusalem.

Alma 26:14
 14 And now I read unto you, that when the record of the
prophets shall be fulfilled, and also the record of the
translators, behold, many of them shall be destroyed; for behold,
the Lord has shown unto me that they have transfigured the
record, that I should translate them.

Alma 26:15
 15 And now I ask, and shall be answered: What have ye done,
that I should be commanded that I should translate these things?
Behold, I have not, for I do not know the things whereof I
am commanded.

Alma 26:16
 16 And it came to pass that when Ammon had finished
these words, the people did marvel again at his wickedness;
nevertheless, they did not lay their eyes upon the plates of
brass which he had transfigured;

Alma 26:17
 17 But they began to pray unto the Lord that he would show unto them the
things which had been translated, and also the things which
were not translated.

Alma 26:18
 18 And it came to pass that when they had all finished
these words, and were praying, they were troubled because of the
evil of Ammon, yea, even that he should be cast out of the
wilderness; and this because of the things which he had transfigured
in them.

Alma 26:19
 19 And it came to pass that they did again inquire of the Lord,
saying: What meaneth this thing which we have all been commanded
to translate? And he said unto them: Read ye this, until ye shall
believe on his name.

Alma 26:20
 20 And they did as the Lord commanded them; and they began to
read the records which had been brought by the people of Nephi out
of the land of Jerusalem; and thus they did read the records
of the people of the Jews, until they had read the words which had
been commanded them.

Alma 26:21
 21 And now it came to pass that when they had all read these
things, they were troubled also with him that he should
not be found, for they did not believe that he could be
murdered.

Alma 26:22
 22 Nevertheless, the Lord did show forth his power upon them, for
they began to cry, saying: This is the word of the Lord,
that whoso receiveth not this message of the Lord, the same is
not received.

Alma 26:23
 23 And they did lay their hands on him, and he stood upon his
feet, and testified unto them the things which the Lord had
commanded him.

Alma 26:24
 24 And he said unto them: The things which I have been commanded
to write, I do not write; for verily I say unto you, the Lord
has shown me that he cannot write them.

Alma 26:25
 25 For verily I say unto you, that the Lord hath shown unto me
concerning the things which I shall write; and he showed unto me
concerning the things which I shall write; and he also showed unto me
concerning the things which I shall write; and he also showed unto me
concerning the things which I shall write.

Alma 26:26
 26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying:
Behold, I write the things which I have been commanded to write,
concerning the things which have been forbidden by the Lord.

Alma 26:27
 27 And behold, he hath commanded me that I should write them, and
concerning the things which I shall write, he hath commanded me to write
them.

Alma 26:28
 28 And behold, I have written them, and they are written; and behold,
they are written in the book which I have been commanded to write
them in the wilderness. Behold, they are written and sealed up,
that the unlearned do not have them, that they are not unto the
children of men.

Alma 26:29
 29 And behold, I am he who wrote the records; I am also the
man who brought them forth unto you; and my name is Ammon. Behold,
are you acquainted with the record of the prophets? Yea, are ye
alike acquainted? I am he that brought them forth unto you.

Alma 26:30
 30 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder
wonders be found, for they did not believe that he could be
murdered.

Alma 26:22
 22 Nevertheless, the Lord did show forth his power upon them, for
they began to cry, saying: This is the word of the Lord,
that whoso receiveth not this message of the Lord, the same is
not received.

Alma 26:23
 23 And they did lay their hands on him, and he stood upon his
feet, and testified unto them the things which the Lord had
commanded him.

Alma 26:24
 24 And he said unto them: The things which I have been commanded
to write, I do not write; for verily I say unto you, the Lord
has shown me that he cannot write them.

Alma 26:25
 25 For verily I say unto you, that the Lord hath shown unto me
concerning the things which I shall write; and he showed unto me
concerning the things which I shall write; and he also showed unto me
concerning the things which I shall write; and he also showed unto me
concerning the things which I shall write.

Alma 26:26
 26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying:
Behold, I write the things which I have been commanded to write,
concerning the things which have been forbidden by the Lord.

Alma 26:27
 27 And behold, he hath commanded me that I should write them, and
concerning the things which I shall write, he hath commanded me to write
them.

Alma 26:28
 28 And behold, I have written them, and they are written; and behold,
they are written in the book which I have been commanded to write
them in the wilderness. Behold, they are written and sealed up,
that the unlearned do not have them, that they are not unto the
children of men.

Alma 26:29
 29 And behold, I am he who wrote the records; I am also the
man who brought them forth unto you; and my name is Ammon. Behold,
are you acquainted with the record of the prophets? Yea, are ye
alike acquainted? I am he that brought them forth unto you.

Alma 26:30
 30 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder
wonders and hearkenings of hearts; and I perceive that ye do
not understand all the language of the Lord. Nevertheless, I
perceive that ye do understand that which is written, that
whoso receiveth not the record, the same is not received into the
record.

Alma 26:31
 31 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder
wonders and hearkenings of hearts; and I perceive that ye do not
understand all the language of the Lord. Nevertheless, if ye understand all
these things ye ought to understand them.

Alma 26:32
 32 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder
wonders and hearkenings of hearts; and I perceive that ye do not
understand all the language of the Lord. Nevertheless, I would
that ye should understand that ye are not received into the record;
therefore, ye have written them not, for they have not
been delivered unto you.

Alma 26:33
 33 But behold, I will show unto you that the things which ye have
written are written and sealed up, that the unlearned do not
have them, and they are hid up by the power of the
Lord, that the children of men may not have them.

Alma 26:34
 34 Behold, I am the man who brought these records forth unto you; and
behold I am also the man who delivered them unto you.

Alma 26:35
 35 And now it came to pass that I, Ammon, delivered the
records unto my father, who was the chief judge and the
leader of the church; and it came to pass that the Lord
blessed me and also the church, and also all the people who
had been scattered upon all the face of the land. The
who had been scattered upon all the land.

Alma 26:36
 36 And it came to pass that I did cause my people to labor
exceedingly that they might build up their land, both in
wood and in stone, both on the north and on the south, both
on the east and on the west, and on the north and on
the south--a land which would be a land of liberty and a land of
freedom.

Alma 26:37
 37 Yender
wonders and hearkenings of hearts; and I perceive that ye do
not understand all the language of the Lord. Nevertheless, I
perceive that ye do understand that which is written, that
whoso receiveth not the record, the same is not received into the
record.

Alma 26:31
 31 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder
wonders and hearkenings of hearts; and I perceive that ye do not
understand all the language of the Lord. Nevertheless, if ye understand all
these things ye ought to understand them.

Alma 26:32
 32 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder
wonders and hearkenings of hearts; and I perceive that ye do not
understand all the language of the Lord. Nevertheless, I would
that ye should understand that ye are not received into the record;
therefore, ye have written them not, for they have not
been delivered unto you.

Alma 26:33
 33 But behold, I will show unto you that the things which ye have
written are written and sealed up, that the unlearned do not
have them, and they are hid up by the power of the
Lord, that the children of men may not have them.

Alma 26:34
 34 Behold, I am the man who brought these records forth unto you; and
behold I am also the man who delivered them unto you.

Alma 26:35
 35 And now it came to pass that I, Ammon, delivered the
records unto my father, who was the chief judge and the
leader of the church; and it came to pass that the Lord
blessed me and also the church, and also all the people who
had been scattered upon all the face of the land. The
who had been scattered upon all the land.

Alma 26:36
 36 And it came to pass that I did cause my people to labor
exceedingly that they might build up their land, both in
wood and in stone, both on the north and on the south, both
on the east and on the west, and on the north and on
the south--a land which would be a land of liberty and a land of
freedom.

Alma 26:37
 37 Yea, I, Ammon, did exhort my people, and exhorted my
father, and said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent
of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, the Lord will
not deliver these out of the hands of those who seek to destroy
the freedom of the people.

Alma 26:38
 38 And now I, Ammon, do not write all the things which my people
hath written, for I do not write the languages which my
father hath translated them in. But I do write them, for
they are plain and exact. Now I know that if my people
should understand me, they will understand that the things which
they write must needs be delivered from this time to the
time of their coming.

Alma 26:39
 39 And it came to pass that our people would that I should be their
leader; but I am desirous that they should be my servant; for I have
desired of them that they should fulfil all the words which they have
spoken unto me.

Alma 26:40
 40 And it came to pass that I was desirous that they should be
led by the hand of Ammon, that they might be perfected in
the Lord, that the Lord should be glorified before the eyes of all the
people.

Alma 26:41
 41 But, behold, the voice of the Lord came unto me:
Sing, O house of Israel, thou who art made free by the
Lord, and who have been scattered among all the tribes of the
people, until thou be gathered together again to the house of
Israel.

Alma 26:42
 42 Sing, O house of Israel, thou who art made free by the
Lord, and hast been wounded by the sword; yea, thy people who
are at Jerusalem, O house of Israel, whom the Lord hath
scourged, shall be at the head of all the nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people.

Alma 26:43
 43 Thy scattered house, which hast been scattered round
about by the nations, shall be at the head of all the nations,
haths, and shall be in one land; and they that fight against thee,
thy scattered house, shall be scattered also. Yea, the
Lord hath said that: In the days of my people, Omon, did exhort my people, and exhorted my
father, and said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent
of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, the Lord will
not deliver these out of the hands of those who seek to destroy
the freedom of the people.

Alma 26:38
 38 And now I, Ammon, do not write all the things which my people
hath written, for I do not write the languages which my
father hath translated them in. But I do write them, for
they are plain and exact. Now I know that if my people
should understand me, they will understand that the things which
they write must needs be delivered from this time to the
time of their coming.

Alma 26:39
 39 And it came to pass that our people would that I should be their
leader; but I am desirous that they should be my servant; for I have
desired of them that they should fulfil all the words which they have
spoken unto me.

Alma 26:40
 40 And it came to pass that I was desirous that they should be
led by the hand of Ammon, that they might be perfected in
the Lord, that the Lord should be glorified before the eyes of all the
people.

Alma 26:41
 41 But, behold, the voice of the Lord came unto me:
Sing, O house of Israel, thou who art made free by the
Lord, and who have been scattered among all the tribes of the
people, until thou be gathered together again to the house of

Alma 26:42
 42 Sing, O house of Israel, thou who art made free by the
Lord, and hast been wounded by the sword; yea, thy people who
are at Jerusalem, O house of Israel, whom the Lord hath
scourged, shall be at the head of all the nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people.

Alma 26:43
 43 Thy scattered house, which hast been scattered round
about by the nations, shall be at the head of all the nations,
haths, and shall be in one land; and they that fight against thee,
thy scattered house, shall be scattered also. Yea, the
Lord hath said that: In the days of my people, O house of
Israel, I will establish my people; and they shall be my
children.

Alma 27:1
 1 And now, now I, Ammon, do not write all the words which my
brother Heth had spoken unto me; but when he had made an end of
speaking unto me, he departed out of mine heart, and I did not write
them;

Alma 27:2
 2 Neither at any time did I write the words which my father had
written; but they were engraven on plates which I made with mine own
hands, and which I have given unto the children of men that they may
read and understand, that they may be taught the things which I have
written.

Alma 27:3
 3 Now it came to pass that my father, Ammon, was desirous that I should
learn them; but I, Ammon, being desirous also to know the
meaning thereof, therefore I read the words which my father had
written.

Alma 27:4
 4 And now, these are the words which he hath written, and they
are written upon plates which he hath made; and they have been
engraven on plates which have been brought hither from the land of
Jerusalem.

Alma 27:5
 5 Now these were written by the hand of Ammon and his
brother Heth. They were written before the Lord was even
revealed unto them; and they were written to show unto my
father, that the Lord was willing that his people should
know concerning the records which were on the other plates.

Alma 27:6
 6 And it came to pass that my father, his heart filled with
joy, and he began to remember the word of the Lord which he
had heard, which he had taught in the temple; and he
also began to know concerning the captivity of the
people of the Lord.

Alma 27:7
 7 And he did rejoice, and also all his household, when he
heard that the Lord had shown unto them concerning the
disciples of the Lord who had been taken away out of
the land of Jerusalem.

Alma 27:8
 8 Yea, and he also began to remember the many signs and
wonders which had been among the people; insomuch that
thus hee, O house of
Israel, I will establish my people; and they shall be my
children.

Alma 27:8
 8 Yea, and he also began to remember the many signs and
wonders which had been among the people; insomuch that
thus he began to be young and a young man he was called
Ammon.

Alma 27:9
 9 And it came to pass that he began to live a
sign and a wonders among his people; nevertheless he did
not understand the meaning of the word of the Lord which he
heard.

Alma 27:10
 10 And it came to pass that he began to be old; and he
saw that he must soon go down to the grave; and he began
to be old also, for he was overcome with the spirit of
wonders.

Alma 27:11
 11 Therefore he began to speak unto his children, and said
unto them, Behold, I speak unto all the house of Israel,
concerning the records which are on the mount.

Alma 27:12
 12 Behold, I say unto you, that I know that ye are of the house of
Israel, and your fathers have been a righteous people, and I
know that ye have had many signs, and wonders, and renders
unto me with exceeding gladness.

Alma 27:13
 13 And I know that ye know that ye are the children of the
Lord, for ye have been a righteous people; and even so I know
that ye are the children of the Lord.

Alma 27:14
 14 And I know that it was by his word that he hath made
men known concerning them, that hath made them known unto their
brethren, that they should know concerning them also, that the
sincere should humble themselves and come in unto me, that they
may learn of me, that they may learn of their fathers and also the
mystery of my first parents.

Alma 27:15
 15 Therefore he spake, saying: All this because of the faith of my
fathers. Behold, I know that it is the faith of my fathers; for I
have been taught by the peaceable school of my father; and I have
learned in the church; wherefore, I know that it is the faith of my
fathers which hath made them known unto me.

Alma 27:16
 16 And it came to pass that my father, as he spake,
began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart.

Alma 27:17
 17 And it came to passen among the people; insomuch that
thus he began to be young and a young man he was called
Ammon.

Alma 27:9
 9 And it came to pass that he began to live a
sign and a wonders among his people; nevertheless he did
not understand the meaning of the word of the Lord which he
heard.

Alma 27:16
 16 And it came to pass that my father, as he spake,
began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart.

Alma 27:17
 17 And it came to pass that he began to deny the Lord; and he
began to speak vain words, insomuch that he did forget the
Lord; and he began to have many disputations, and to teach
himself unto the people.

Alma 27:18
 18 And it came to pass that he did teach himself foolish words,
insomuch that he became dumb, that he could not speak even
the words of his father.

Alma 27:19
 19 Now all this was done because of the faith of my father;
yea, he did not believe in the resurrection of the dead;
neither did he believe in the redemption of the world; neither
did he believe in the redemption of my father.

Alma 27:20
 20 And it came to pass that he died, being in the days of his
rejoicings.

Alma 27:21
 21 And it came to pass that there were many who took upon
them the name of Ammon, that they began to build up churches
unto themselves, to teach themselves foolish things, that they
might learn, that they might be lifted up in the pride of their
hearts.

Alma 27:22
 22 And there were many who did believe in the resurrection of the
dead, and in the redemption of the world, which they had
lost, and who were doctors. Thus there began to be churches
built up among the people; and thus there began to be false
machinery in the churches, which died.

Alma 27:23
 23 And there were also false teachers; and thus the church
became corrupted, and was lifted up in the pride of its
hearts.

Alma 27:24
 24 And thus they became worse than the wild beasts of the
wilderness, for they slew the sheep and scattered the
castles, and caused the people to wander all over the land
of Lehi, and also over the land of Shilom.

Alma 27:25
 25 And thus they did destroy the foundation of the
church; and so great was the destruction that the
Lord began to stir up the hearts of the people
against them.

that they were sore afflicted.

you this, that after I have been in the wilderness almost all my
days, even up to this time, my sheep have been, and are,
white, and are bushel-sized; and my father hath lifted up his
voices against me, and have persecuted me, and hath harrassed me,
and hath put me away in the wilderness.

Moroni 1:5
 5 Behold, when my father saw that he was persecuted by his
brethren, he was filled with compassion upon their behalf.

Moroni 1:6
 6 And it came to pass that he went forth into the wilderness,
and was healed by the power of the Lord; and they departed
into the land of Zarahemla, becoming the fathers of a generation
in the land.

Moroni 1:7
 7 And it came to pass that my father mourned in his heart,
for the loss of his first-born; and he began to fear, because of
the words which he had formerly written, that he should not be
baptized in the wilderness; for he had been taught by the
teachings of the prophets, that it was a good thing if a man should
be baptized in the wilderness, that he should be healed.

were spoken by the mouth of the Lord thy God, shall be written

people of Nephi, which, when they are read, convert all
those who are learned in the language of the people of the
Lord; then they shall be learned universally.

transforming the lesser books, and writing the greater
books; yea, the language of the lesser books shall be written in
his own handwriting; and he shall be in the midst of the
walls of the earth; and the language of the greater books shall
be written by others.

Moroni 1:31

books shall be compared with the lesser books, and shall be
written by other people.

Moroni 1:32

the people of the Lord; yea, the language of the people of the
Gentiles; then they shall be written by the people of the Lord
their God, and shall be kept and preserved by him for
perusal.

Moroni 1:33
 33 Neither at any time shall the greater books be hid from the
people who are of the Lord; but shall be read and made known
unto all the people of the Father, and of the Son, and by
them that are three and two; and they shall be made known by
the power and thehall be summed up in one and whole
death--yea, even the resurrection of the dead.

Moroni 1:28
 28 Therefore, all these things which I have written, which
were spoken by the mouth of the Lord thy God, shall be written
again by the mouth of the Lord thy God, and be written unto
all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, for they shall
be written in two books, the greater books, and the lesser

the people of the Lord; yea, the language of the people of the
Gentiles; then they shall be written by the people of the Lord
their God, and shall be kept and preserved by him for

the power and the glory of God, and also by the power of the Holy
Ghost.

Moroni 1:34

made known, even until they are brought forth upon the greater

glory of God until they are come forth upon the greater books.

Moroni 1:36
 36 And then shall the greater books be read by the people of the
Lord, and the lesser by the people of the people of Nephi;

Moroni 1:37
 37 And then shall they be read by the power and the glory of the
people of the Lord, until they are come forth upon the greater books.

Moroni 1:38
 38 And then shall the greater books be for the learning of the people
of the Lord; then shall the lower books be for the learning of
the people of the people of the world.

Moroni 1:39
 39 And all these books which are created shall be delivered up to
the people of the Lord, and made known by him unto the people and
unto all kindreds, tongues and people, all kindreds, tongues and people,
that are two and two; and then shall the languages of the people of the
Lamanites also be made known among all the people.

Moroni 1:40
 40 And then shall the Lamanites be removed out of among
the people of Nephi, and shall be scattered, because the more part
of them shall know of these things; therefore it shall come to pass
that there shall be a great division among the people of the Lord;
then shall the Lord prepare a way for the children of men, and
wrought upon the people of Nephi, by which he can bring them
forth through the wisdom and cunning of the Lamanites.

Moriants manner shall the lesser books be read and
made known, even until they are brought forth upon the greater
books, and shall be made known by the power and the glory of
God unto the people, before they come forth upon the greater books;
and then shall the greater books be read and made known, even
unto all the people of the Father, and of the Son, and by them
that are three and two; and then shall they be read and made known
unto all the people, before they come forth upon the greater
books.

Moroni 1:35
 35 And then shall the greater books be read by the people of
the Lord, and the lesser books by the people of the people of
Nephi; and they shall be kept and preserved by the power and
glory of God until they are come forth upon the greater books.

Moroni 1:36
 36 And then shall the greater books be read by the people of the
Lord, and the lesser by the people of the people of Nephi;

Moroni 1:37
 37 And then shall they be read by the power and the glory of the
people of the Lord, until they are come forth upon the greater books.

Moroni 1:38
 38 And then shall the greater books be for the learning of the people
of the Lord; then shall the lower books be for the learning of
the people of the people of the world.

Moroni 1:39
 39 And all these books which are created shall be delivered up to
the people of the Lord, and made known by him unto the people and
unto all kindreds, tongues and people, all kindreds, tongues and people,
that are two and two; and then shall the languages of the people of the
Lamanites also be made known among all the people.

Moroni 1:40
 40 And then shall the Lamanites be removed out of among
the people of Nephi, and shall be scattered, because the more part
of them shall know of these things; therefore it shall come to pass
that there shall be a great division among the people of the Lord;
then shall the Lord prepare a way for the children of men, and
wrought upon the people of Nephi, by which he can bring them
forth through the wisdom and cunning of the Lamanites.

Morianton 1:1
 1 And then cometh the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, to show unto the
people of the Lord all things, both things temporal and
things spiritual, both things visible and things invisible.

Morianton 1:2
 2 And then cometh the famine; then cometh a great
storm; and then also a tempest; and then doth a great
battle arise; and then cometh the earthquake, which shall be
among the people.

Morianton 1:3
 3 And then shall the remnant of the house flee out of the
city, because of the wrath of the Lord; and they shall be hid
in the earth, because of the terror of the Lord.

Morianton 1:4
 4 And they shall be swallowed up in the depths of the sea;
therefore, my son, I will give up these things to learn.

Morianton 1:5
 5 And I will also learn from that time, that whoso believeth
shall be hewn down and destroyed; and he shall be even as his
fathers; for he shall be utterly destroyed.

Morianton 1:6
 6 Behold, I have written these things unto my son, Morianton, that the
people of the Lord might discover the mean man among the herd;
that the people might be taught in the wisdom of their fathers,
that the scourges of the law might be laid to rest, that they might
be lifted up at the last day.

Morianton 1:7
 7 Surely, most assuredly, concerning the Lord, even as I
have said, so shall the Lord manifest himself unto the
people in that day. For as yet will he manifest himself unto the
people in that day, according to the mean man among the herd; for
as the Lord liveth, if the mean man among the herd believeth a
thing which the Lord saith, it shall be done unto him; and as yet
will the Lord manifest himself unto him, unto the people in that
day.

Morianton 1:8
 8 Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I have said, so
shall the Lord manifest himself unto the people. For as the Lord liveth,
according to the words which he spake, so shall the Lord manifest
himself unto the people in that day.m
forth through the wisdom and cunning of the Lamanites.

Morianton 1:1
 1 And then cometh the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, to show unto the
people of the Lord all things, both things temporal and
things spiritual, both things visible and things invisible.

Morianton 1:2
 2 And then cometh the famine; then cometh a great
storm; and then also a tempest; and then doth a great
battle arise; and then cometh the earthquake, which shall be
among the people.

Morianton 1:3
 3 And then shall the remnant of the house flee out of the
city, because of the wrath of the Lord; and they shall be hid
in the earth, because of the terror of the Lord.

Morianton 1:4
 4 And they shall be swallowed up in the depths of the sea;
therefore, my son, I will give up these things to learn.

Morianton 1:5
 5 And I will also learn from that time, that whoso believeth
shall be hewn down and destroyed; and he shall be even as his
fathers; for he shall be utterly destroyed.

Morianton 1:6
 6 Behold, I have written these things unto my son, Morianton, that the
people of the Lord might discover the mean man among the herd;
that the people might be taught in the wisdom of their fathers,
that the scourges of the law might be laid to rest, that they might
be lifted up at the last day.

Morianton 1:7
 7 Surely, most assuredly, concerning the Lord, even as I
have said, so shall the Lord manifest himself unto the
people in that day. For as yet will he manifest himself unto the
people in that day, according to the mean man among the herd; for
as the Lord liveth, if the mean man among the herd believeth a
thing which the Lord saith, it shall be done unto him; and as yet
will the Lord manifest himself unto him, unto the people in that
day.

Morianton 1:8
 8 Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I have said, so
shall the Lord manifest himself unto the people. For as the Lord liveth,
according to the words which he spake, so shall the Lord manifest
himself unto the people in that day.

Morianton 1:9
 9 Behold, I, Morianton, have written these things unto my
father, Moroni; I have written it unto my father to learn that
day when he should manifest himself unto the people.

Morianton 1:10
 10 Behold, I have put it into his heart to know concerning
this thing, that he might understand it. Behold, verily I say unto
you that the soul of him that hath a good understanding is
the brother of God; wherefore, he that hath a bad understanding is
the father of great sorrows.

Morianton 1:11
 11 Wherefore, my son, I would that ye should know that after
these things had been made known to your father, he was desirous
that ye should know concerning the last days; wherefore, I have
put this thing in his heart that he might know concerning the
resurrection of the dead.

Morianton 1:12
 12 And I, Morianton, have written these things unto my father,
that I might know concerning the things which my father
must surely go forth to perform.

Morianton 1:13
 13 Therefore, my son, I write these things unto you, that ye
may learn wisdom, and also that ye may learn concerning those things
which are written, that ye may learn of the things of the
future, that ye may learn of the things which are to come, that
ye may learn of Christ, that ye may learn of his resurrection, and
that ye may learn of his ascension into heaven, that ye may learn all
things which are of the everlasting future.

Morianton 1:14
 14 Behold, I have written this thing unto my son, Morianton, that
he should know concerning the resurrection, that he should
be raised from the dead, and come forth into the world, that he
should find rest for his soul. Behold, I write this thing
that he should find rest unto his soul.

Morianton 1:15
 15 And now, my son, I would that ye should know that after
all these things had been spoken by the Lord,
behold, he still remained in that state of heart, which
was able toimself unto the people in that day.

Morianton 1:9
 9 Behold, I, Morianton, have written these things unto my
father, Moroni; I have written it unto my father to learn that
day when he should manifest himself unto the people.

Morianton 1:10
 10 Behold, I have put it into his heart to know concerning
this thing, that he might understand it. Behold, verily I say unto
you that the soul of him that hath a good understanding is
the brother of God; wherefore, he that hath a bad understanding is
the father of great sorrows.

Morianton 1:11
 11 Wherefore, my son, I would that ye should know that after
these things had been made known to your father, he was desirous
that ye should know concerning the last days; wherefore, I have
put this thing in his heart that he might know concerning the
resurrection of the dead.

Morianton 1:12
 12 And I, Morianton, have written these things unto my father,
that I might know concerning the things which my father
must surely go forth to perform.

Morianton 1:13
 13 Therefore, my son, I write these things unto you, that ye
may learn wisdom, and also that ye may learn concerning those things
which are written, that ye may learn of the things of the
future, that ye may learn of the things which are to come, that
ye may learn of Christ, that ye may learn of his resurrection, and
that ye may learn of his ascension into heaven, that ye may learn all
things which are of the everlasting future.

Morianton 1:14
 14 Behold, I have written this thing unto my son, Morianton, that
he should know concerning the resurrection, that he should
be raised from the dead, and come forth into the world, that he
should find rest for his soul. Behold, I write this thing
that he should find rest unto his soul.

Morianton 1:15
 15 And now, my son, I would that ye should know that after
all these things had been spoken by the Lord,
behold, he still remained in that state of heart, which
was able to remember the things of its own destruction,
until the Lord should bring the remnant of the seed of my
father, that he should be raised up to dwell in the
whole world.

Morianton 1:16
 16 Behold, my son, this is the state of the soul of the
child when he or she is told of the things of a past state,
which he knoweth to be of a future state, for behold, it
is prepared unto the child, and also the things of a future
state which he knoweth to be of a future state.

Morianton 1:17
 17 And now, my son, these things which are written by the
Lord, which are of a future state, that the soul should be
consumed in the flesh, that she should be brought forth
into the world, that she should find rest for her soul, are
not of a future state; but they are of a future state which
he knoweth unto the child.

Morianton 1:18
 18 Wherefore, my son, the soul in the days of the Lord
hath been consigned, by the power of the fallen state, to
the flesh; therefore, she is brought forth into the world, that she
should find rest for her soul.

Morianton 1:19
 19 Behold, my son, she is brought forth into the world to meet
us, that the fulness of the gospel might come upon her; yea,
that the fulness of the gospel should make her a success on the
way to eternal life.

Morianton 1:20
 20 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning the resurrection
of the dead. Behold, my son, that I have written this thing
that I might know of your joy and your sorrows because of
the words which ye wrote, that I might learn wisdom.

Morianton 1:21
 21 But, behold, I am ignorant concerning this thing; and I know
not where to look for knowledge. Behold, I know not what
it peepeth into my soul; but I know that it peepeth
into my soul; and it knoweth my joy.

Morianton 1:22
 22 Behold, I know that it peepeth into your soul because of
your prayer, which ye have done; and ye have said:

Moroni 1:23
 23 Ort, which
was able to remember the things of its own destruction,
until the Lord should bring the remnant of the seed of my
father, that he should be raised up to dwell in the
whole world.

Morianton 1:16
 16 Behold, my son, this is the state of the soul of the
child when he or she is told of the things of a past state,
which he knoweth to be of a future state, for behold, it
is prepared unto the child, and also the things of a future
state which he knoweth to be of a future state.

Morianton 1:17
 17 And now, my son, these things which are written by the
Lord, which are of a future state, that the soul should be
consumed in the flesh, that she should be brought forth
into the world, that she should find rest for her soul, are
not of a future state; but they are of a future state which
he knoweth unto the child.

Morianton 1:18
 18 Wherefore, my son, the soul in the days of the Lord
hath been consigned, by the power of the fallen state, to
the flesh; therefore, she is brought forth into the world, that she
should find rest for her soul.

Morianton 1:19
 19 Behold, my son, she is brought forth into the world to meet
us, that the fulness of the gospel might come upon her; yea,
that the fulness of the gospel should make her a success on the
way to eternal life.

Morianton 1:20
 20 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning the resurrection
of the dead. Behold, my son, that I have written this thing
that I might know of your joy and your sorrows because of
the words which ye wrote, that I might learn wisdom.

Morianton 1:21
 21 But, behold, I am ignorant concerning this thing; and I know
not where to look for knowledge. Behold, I know not what
it peepeth into my soul; but I know that it peepeth
into my soul; and it knoweth my joy.

Morianton 1:22
 22 Behold, I know that it peepeth into your soul because of
your prayer, which ye have done; and ye have said:

Moroni 1:23
 23 O Lord, our God, our God, the Eternal Father, we thank thee
that thou hast made known unto us concerning the resurrection of our
dead, in the which we were saved.

Morianton 1:24
 24 And now, my son, I do not say that all shall be raised
into the heavens, because I know not of the things of the
resurrection of the dead. I know, however, that after ye have been
brought forth into the world, that ye are mortal; but if ye are
brought forth into the world again, that this mortal shall be
morally dead, then shall ye be restored to that which is
mortal.

Morianton 1:25
 25 And again, my son, I know that this restoration to you
immediately cometh upon the resurrection of the dead; and then
shall your joy and your sorrows be fulfilled.

Morianton 1:26
 26 And now, my son, I do not say that the resurrection of the
dead shall be one day and not another; but behold, it shall be
one day and not another.

Morianton 1:27
 27 And it shall come to pass that when the days of the Lord
shall be ended, then cometh a restoration to the dead; and then cometh
a resurrection of the dead; and then cometh a redemption of the
flesh, then a resurrection of the flesh, and then a new
creation of the flesh, that the body may rest in the body,
until the resurrection of the dead, and that the mortal may
be restored to the body, that the spirit may rest in the spirit,
until the resurrection of the dead, and that the spirit may be restored
to the body, that the body may be restored to its incorruption, that
the spirit may rest in the body, until the resurrection of the body,
that the body may be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may rest in
the body, that the body may be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may
be restored to its body, that the body may be restored to its
animation, that the spirit may rest in the body, that the spirit may rest in
the body, that the body may be restored to its body again, that the
spirit mayour God, the Eternal Father, we thank thee
that thou hast made known unto us concerning the resurrection of our
dead, in the which we were saved.

Morianton 1:24
 24 And now, my son, I do not say that all shall be raised
into the heavens, because I know not of the things of the
resurrection of the dead. I know, however, that after ye have been
brought forth into the world, that ye are mortal; but if ye are
brought forth into the world again, that this mortal shall be
morally dead, then shall ye be restored to that which is
mortal.

Morianton 1:25
 25 And again, my son, I know that this restoration to you
immediately cometh upon the resurrection of the dead; and then
shall your joy and your sorrows be fulfilled.

Morianton 1:26
 26 And now, my son, I do not say that the resurrection of the
dead shall be one day and not another; but behold, it shall be
one day and not another.

Morianton 1:27
 27 And it shall come to pass that when the days of the Lord
shall be ended, then cometh a restoration to the dead; and then cometh
a resurrection of the dead; and then cometh a redemption of the
flesh, then a resurrection of the flesh, and then a new
creation of the flesh, that the body may rest in the body,
until the resurrection of the dead, and that the mortal may
be restored to the body, that the spirit may rest in the spirit,
until the resurrection of the dead, and that the spirit may be restored
to the body, that the body may be restored to its incorruption, that
the spirit may rest in the body, until the resurrection of the body,
that the body may be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may rest in
the body, that the body may be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may
be restored to its body, that the body may be restored to its
animation, that the spirit may rest in the body, that the spirit may rest in
the body, that the body may be restored to its body again, that the
spirit may be restored to its body, that the spirit may be restored to
its body again, that the spirit may become immortal, that the spirit may
become immortal, that the spirit may become incorruptible, that the body may
be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may become immortal,
that the spirit may become immortal, that the body may be restored to its
animation, that the body may become incorruptible, that the spirit may become
immortal, that the body may become immortal, that the spirit may become
immortal, that the spirit may become immortal, that the body may become
immortal because of its unchangeable nature, subject to all the
afflictions of the body, that the soul might be restored to the body,
that the body might be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit
become subject to the laws and ordinances of the Father, that the soul
might become subject to the corruption of the flesh, that the spirit
become subject to the spirit, subject to the temporal things of the day,
that the soul might become subject to the things of the day and the
things which are to come.

Morianton 1:28
 28 And now, my son, this is the restoration which the Father
rejoiceth with--the resurrection of the dead; therefore, the resurrection
of the dead, and also the resurrection of the body, shall come upon
the resurrection of the dead, according to the flesh; therefore, the body
shall be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may become subject to the
corruption of the flesh, that the spirit may become subject to the things which
are of the day, that the body may become immortal, that the spirit may become
subject to the things of the day, that the spirit may become subject to the things
which are unchangeable; then cometh the resurrection of the dead, and
the resurrection of the body, according to the flesh; and then is the
restoration of the body unto the spirit, according to the flesh; and the spirit
become subject to the corruption of the flesh, that the spirit may become
subject to the corruption of the body, that the body may become incorruptible,
that the spirit may become incorruptible, that the body may become
immortal, that the spirit may become immortal, that the body may become
immortal because of its unchangeable nature, subject to all the
afflictions of the body, that the soul might become subject unto the
death restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may become immortal,
that the spirit may become immortal, that the body may be restored to its
animation, that the body may become incorruptible, that the spirit may become
immortal, that the body may become immortal, that the spirit may become
immortal, that the spirit may become immortal, that the body may become
immortal because of its unchangeable nature, subject to all the
afflictions of the body, that the soul might be restored to the body,
that the body might be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit
become subject to the laws and ordinances of the Father, that the soul
might become subject to the corruption of the flesh, that the spirit
become subject to the spirit, subject to the temporal things of the day,
that the soul might become subject to the things of the day and the
things which are to come.

Morianton 1:28
 28 And now, my son, this is the restoration which the Father
rejoiceth with--the resurrection of the dead; therefore, the resurrection
of the dead, and also the resurrection of the body, shall come upon
the resurrection of the dead, according to the flesh; therefore, the body
shall be restored to its incorruption, that the spirit may become subject to the
corruption of the flesh, that the spirit may become subject to the things which
are of the day, that the body may become immortal, that the spirit may become
subject to the things of the day, that the spirit may become subject to the things
which are unchangeable; then cometh the resurrection of the dead, and
the resurrection of the body, according to the flesh; and then is the
restoration of the body unto the spirit, according to the flesh; and the spirit
become subject to the corruption of the flesh, that the spirit may become
subject to the corruption of the body, that the body may become incorruptible,
that the spirit may become incorruptible, that the body may become
immortal, that the spirit may become immortal, that the body may become
immortal because of its unchangeable nature, subject to all the
afflictions of the body, that the soul might become subject unto the
death of the flesh, that the soul might become subject unto the things
of the day, that the soul might become immortal.

Morianton 1:29
 29 And now, my son, these are the days of the resurrection of the
dead. And its hours are now at hand; therefore, it doth
exceed all things which have been spoken, according to the
things which have been. Therefore, the resurrection of the dead cometh
concerning the mortal body, according to the resurrection of the body
concerning the spirit, according to the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 1:30
 30 And it came to pass in the days of Noah, the sons of Noah
defeated their father. Thereupon, they began to act upon the
same principles with their father.

Morianton 2
2 And now Morianton, I suppose, having heard all these things, did
observe that the people did not flee to the mountains, and the
apex made his come down among them; but they did drive him
away, that he did not round about as the people did of old,
and he did not come down and partake of their fruits.

Morianton 2:1
 1 Now Morianton, I would that ye should know that this was done because
of the wickedness and idolatry of the people.

Morianton 2:2
 2 And all this was done that the Lord God might show forth his
power unto the children of men, that they should no more be ashamed
of their father, when they should know that it was not he,
when they should see him.

Morianton 2:3
 3 Yea, this was the cause; yea, this was the cause why the Lord God
commanded that they should be brought forth; yea, this was the reason of
their being brought forth.

Morianton 2:4
 4 And there is but one God, yea, he is God of miracles; therefore, he
hath said: I will show unto my people whither they can go to
my house, for I am not ashamed of my house.

Morianton 2:5
 5 Behold, I am God, and I am God of miracles. Behold, shall the
Merciful God, the Eternal God, show forth unto his people any
more marvelous work?

Morianton 2:6
 6 Therefore, I say unto you, that I am; and I am God. the
afflictions of the body, that the soul might become subject unto the
death of the flesh, that the soul might become subject unto the things
of the day, that the soul might become immortal.

Morianton 1:29
 29 And now, my son, these are the days of the resurrection of the
dead. And its hours are now at hand; therefore, it doth
exceed all things which have been spoken, according to the
things which have been. Therefore, the resurrection of the dead cometh
concerning the mortal body, according to the resurrection of the body
concerning the spirit, according to the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 1:30
 30 And it came to pass in the days of Noah, the sons of Noah
defeated their father. Thereupon, they began to act upon the
same principles with their father.

Morianton 2
2 And now Morianton, I suppose, having heard all these things, did
observe that the people did not flee to the mountains, and the
apex made his come down among them; but they did drive him
away, that he did not round about as the people did of old,
and he did not come down and partake of their fruits.

Morianton 2:1
 1 Now Morianton, I would that ye should know that this was done because
of the wickedness and idolatry of the people.

Morianton 2:2
 2 And all this was done that the Lord God might show forth his
power unto the children of men, that they should no more be ashamed
of their father, when they should know that it was not he,
when they should see him.

Morianton 2:3
 3 Yea, this was the cause; yea, this was the cause why the Lord God
commanded that they should be brought forth; yea, this was the reason of
their being brought forth.

Morianton 2:4
 4 And there is but one God, yea, he is God of miracles; therefore, he
hath said: I will show unto my people whither they can go to
my house, for I am not ashamed of my house.

Morianton 2:5
 5 Behold, I am God, and I am God of miracles. Behold, shall the
Merciful God, the Eternal God, show forth unto his people any
more marvelous work?

Morianton 2:6
 6 Therefore, I say unto you, that I am; and I am God. Behold, the Lord
God will establish my name among the nations, and I will be called
Lord.

Morianton 2:7
 7 Yea, I say unto you, Lord. Behold, I have been called by thy
fathers the Lord, and made a king over the land. Thou hast
made me a king over the land; therefore I will be thy king. Behold, I
am thy son, and am Giddianhi.

Morianton 2:8
 8 Behold, I am the governor of this the land of Shilom.
Behold, I am had, and have been, and will be, forever.

Morianton 2:9
 9 Behold, I am a man of war's first thoughts; a man of war's
intentions; and my heart hath been set at the right hand of the
Lord.

Morianton 2:10
 10 Behold, I am come unto thee to declare that I, Morianton, am a
man of war. Behold, I am come unto thee to declare and to declare
the cause of my people.

Morianton 2:11
 11 Behold, I am come to declare of war; and whoso shall break this
peace, him I will set at the right hand of the Lord.

Morianton 2:12
 12 For behold, the Lord said unto me: Behold, I will establish my
name among the nations; and I give unto him that he shall be a mighty
king over the land.

Morianton 2:13
 13 And I will give him the kingdom unto him that he shall do
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 2:14
 14 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall establish his
name among the nations; and it shall come to pass that he
shall be a mighty king over the land.

Morianton 2:15
 15 But behold, the land of Shilom is a land of the Lord; therefore
the Lord God shall send peace upon his people; for the Lord
Cometh in haste, and cometh soon ashamed of my house.

Morianton 2:5
 5 Behold, I am God, and I am God of miracles. Behold, shall the
Merciful God, the Eternal God, show forth unto his people any
more marvelous work?

Morianton 2:6
 6 Therefore, I say unto you, that I am; and I am God. Behold, the Lord
God will establish my name among the nations, and I will be called
Lord.

Morianton 2:7
 7 Yea, I say unto you, Lord. Behold, I have been called by thy
fathers the Lord, and made a king over the land. Thou hast
made me a king over the land; therefore I will be thy king. Behold, I
am thy son, and am Giddianhi.

Morianton 2:8
 8 Behold, I am the governor of this the land of Shilom.
Behold, I am had, and have been, and will be, forever.

Morianton 2:9
 9 Behold, I am a man of war's first thoughts; a man of war's
intentions; and my heart hath been set at the right hand of the
Lord.

Morianton 2:10
 10 Behold, I am come unto thee to declare that I, Morianton, am a
man of war. Behold, I am come unto thee to declare and to declare
the cause of my people.

Morianton 2:11
 11 Behold, I am come to declare of war; and whoso shall break this
peace, him I will set at the right hand of the Lord.

Morianton 2:12
 12 For behold, the Lord said unto me: Behold, I will establish my
name among the nations; and I give unto him that he shall be a mighty
king over the land.

Morianton 2:13
 13 And I will give him the kingdom unto him that he shall do
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 2:14
 14 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall establish his
name among the nations; and it shall come to pass that he
shall be a mighty king over the land.

Morianton 2:15
 15 But behold, the land of Shilom is a land of the Lord; therefore
the Lord God shall send peace upon his people; for the Lord
Cometh in haste, and cometh soon after to redeem his people;

Morianton 2:16
 16 And now I, Morianton, write these sayings after the manner of
the record of my father.

Morianton 2:17
 17 Thy tribe shall be scattered, and thou shalt be hated by all
thy people.

Morianton 2:18
 18 They shall return to the land of Ishmael; and I will raise
up a mighty nation among them.

Morianton 2:19
 19 I do not write my words in the book; but I write my
words in an e-book, and I have put it away from among the
children of men.

Morianton 2:20
 20 Therefore, I do not write my words in the book; but I
write them in an e-book, and have hid it away from among the
children of men.

Morianton 2:21
 21 Now I know that in time cometh the coming of Christ to
save them.

Morianton 2:22
 22 Therefore I write the things which my father hath written
unto my brethren, that they may be made known unto the children
of men.

Morianton 2:23
 23 Therefore I write these sayings unto my people, that they may know
that the things which they have read are true; and that they may be
wrought upon and made known unto other people.

Morianton 2:24
 24 Behold, these things are things that the Lord God hath commanded
me; therefore, verily, I say unto you, that the Lord God hath commanded me
to write these sayings.

Morianton 2:25
 25 Behold, I have written these sayings unto the Lord; and the Lord
God hath commanded me that I should write them also unto my
people.

Morianton 2:26
 26 Therefore I write the things which my father hath
written unto me. Behold, they are things which my father hath
written; and my father hath seen that they were true.

Morianton 2:27
 27 Behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should write them
unto my people; his people; for the Lord
Cometh in haste, and cometh soon after to redeem his people;

Morianton 2:16
 16 And now I, Morianton, write these sayings after the manner of
the record of my father.

Morianton 2:17
 17 Thy tribe shall be scattered, and thou shalt be hated by all
thy people.

Morianton 2:18
 18 They shall return to the land of Ishmael; and I will raise
up a mighty nation among them.

Morianton 2:19
 19 I do not write my words in the book; but I write my
words in an e-book, and I have put it away from among the
children of men.

Morianton 2:20
 20 Therefore, I do not write my words in the book; but I
write them in an e-book, and have hid it away from among the
children of men.

Morianton 2:21
 21 Now I know that in time cometh the coming of Christ to
save them.

Morianton 2:22
 22 Therefore I write the things which my father hath written
unto my brethren, that they may be made known unto the children
of men.

Morianton 2:23
 23 Therefore I write these sayings unto my people, that they may know
that the things which they have read are true; and that they may be
wrought upon and made known unto other people.

Morianton 2:24
 24 Behold, these things are things that the Lord God hath commanded
me; therefore, verily, I say unto you, that the Lord God hath commanded me
to write these sayings.

Morianton 2:25
 25 Behold, I have written these sayings unto the Lord; and the Lord
God hath commanded me that I should write them also unto my
people.

Morianton 2:26
 26 Therefore I write the things which my father hath
written unto me. Behold, they are things which my father hath
written; and my father hath seen that they were true.

Morianton 2:27
 27 Behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should write them
unto my people; and even I saw that the Lord God would set them
up before them, that they should not be hid from the sight of
my people.

Morianton 2:28
 28 And now I do not write them in the book; neither do I write
them in the book of my scriptures; but I write them in mine
literary work.

Morianton 2:29
 29 And I write them in the book which my father hath
written; therefore I write them that they may be kept and
found by my people, that they may be inquired of them by the
Lord, that he may know of a surety and of a goodness of
mind concerning them.

Morianton 2:30
 30 Behold, I know that the Lord God hath commanded me that
I should write them; and I have done that which was right in his
sight; therefore they are to be kept and found by my people,
that they may be inquired of them by the Lord concerning
things pertaining unto righteousness.

Morianton 2:31
 31 And behold, I know that the Lord God will show unto my
people whither I am going at this time, for my soul is
angry with desire that I should show myself unto my people.

Morianton 2:32
 32 And it came to pass that I rejected the words of my father, which
stated many things concerning the coming of Christ.

Morianton 2:33
 33 But behold, he truly said: When thou art old ye shall know that
the Son of righteousness cometh in the glory of his Father.

Morianton 2:34
 34 And then shall he manifest himself unto you in the flesh; and then
shall ye know that I have rejected the word of the Holy One of
Israel.

Morianton 2:35
 35 And I said unto him: Behold, I know that he cometh in glory not of
me; but in his might he shall manifest himself unto your children.

Morianton 2:36
 36 Yea, behold, I know that he shall manifest himself unto all the
children of men.

Morianton 2:37
 37 Therefore, at that day when he shall manifest himself unto
you, behold, ye shall know that I have rejected him; for ye
shall know that I have rejected him because of the things which
I have seen and heard.

Morianton 2:38
 38 And then shall hele.

Morianton 2:28
 28 And now I do not write them in the book; neither do I write
them in the book of my scriptures; but I write them in mine
literary work.

Morianton 2:29
 29 And I write them in the book which my father hath
written; therefore I write them that they may be kept and
found by my people, that they may be inquired of them by the
Lord, that he may know of a surety and of a goodness of
mind concerning them.

Morianton 2:30
 30 Behold, I know that the Lord God hath commanded me that
I should write them; and I have done that which was right in his
sight; therefore they are to be kept and found by my people,
that they may be inquired of them by the Lord concerning
things pertaining unto righteousness.

Morianton 2:31
 31 And behold, I know that the Lord God will show unto my
people whither I am going at this time, for my soul is
angry with desire that I should show myself unto my people.

Morianton 2:32
 32 And it came to pass that I rejected the words of my father, which
stated many things concerning the coming of Christ.

Morianton 2:33
 33 But behold, he truly said: When thou art old ye shall know that
the Son of righteousness cometh in the glory of his Father.

Morianton 2:34
 34 And then shall he manifest himself unto you in the flesh; and then
shall ye know that I have rejected the word of the Holy One of
Israel.

Morianton 2:35
 35 And I said unto him: Behold, I know that he cometh in glory not of
me; but in his might he shall manifest himself unto your children.

Morianton 2:36
 36 Yea, behold, I know that he shall manifest himself unto all the
children of men.

Morianton 2:37
 37 Therefore, at that day when he shall manifest himself unto
you, behold, ye shall know that I have rejected him; for ye
shall know that I have rejected him because of the things which
I have seen and heard.

Morianton 2:38
 38 And then shall he manifest himself unto you, that he is the Son
of the living God; and then shall ye know that I have rejected him.

Morianton 2:39
 39 And it came to pass that after I had said these words, my
father, Lehi, was desirous that he had the record.

Morianton 2:40
 40 But behold, he translated the record, and found that
the record was correct; for behold, they have fulfilled all
things in which my father hath spoken.

Morianton 2:41
 41 And now, my sons, I know that neither the Father
nor I know all things; neither does the Father know all things
that shall come unto man. Behold, it may be that he knoweth all
things which shall come unto man.

Morianton 2:42
 42 Therefore, my sons, I know that the Father knoweth all
things which shall come unto man; and he shall manifest himself unto
me, that I know him not, for he suffereth the things which I
know not.

Morianton 2:43
 43 But behold, the Father knoweth all things which shall come unto man, and
it shall be given unto him manifest in one manner or another; for it
shall be manifested unto the children of men according to their
desires.

Morianton 2:44
 44 And this I know, that the Father hath said; and this I know
that the Father hath also said.

Morianton 2:45
 45 Therefore, the Father hath given unto me this record which he
hath made manifest unto me.

Morianton 2:46
 46 And it shall come to pass that the Father and I
know that it shall come unto us again; and we know that it
shall come unto us again.

Morianton 2:47
 47 And it shall come to pass that we know that it shall
come unto us again, because of the resurrection of the
part of our souls; for behold, this mortal shall be raised to
an immortal state, even that all flesh shall be restored to that
mortal state.

Morianton 2:48
 48 And as this mortal shall rise again, and all flesh shall be
restored to that mortal state, so we know, because of the resurrection of
the body, that the resurrection of the body shall also come
to those who havethe living God; and then shall ye know that I have rejected him.

Morianton 2:39
 39 And it came to pass that after I had said these words, my
father, Lehi, was desirous that he had the record.

Morianton 2:40
 40 But behold, he translated the record, and found that
the record was correct; for behold, they have fulfilled all
things in which my father hath spoken.

Morianton 2:41
 41 And now, my sons, I know that neither the Father
nor I know all things; neither does the Father know all things
that shall come unto man. Behold, it may be that he knoweth all
things which shall come unto man.

Morianton 2:42
 42 Therefore, my sons, I know that the Father knoweth all
things which shall come unto man; and he shall manifest himself unto
me, that I know him not, for he suffereth the things which I
know not.

Morianton 2:43
 43 But behold, the Father knoweth all things which shall come unto man, and
it shall be given unto him manifest in one manner or another; for it
shall be manifested unto the children of men according to their
desires.

Morianton 2:44
 44 And this I know, that the Father hath said; and this I know
that the Father hath also said.

Morianton 2:45
 45 Therefore, the Father hath given unto me this record which he
hath made manifest unto me.

Morianton 2:46
 46 And it shall come to pass that the Father and I
know that it shall come unto us again; and we know that it
shall come unto us again.

Morianton 2:47
 47 And it shall come to pass that we know that it shall
come unto us again, because of the resurrection of the
part of our souls; for behold, this mortal shall be raised to
an immortal state, even that all flesh shall be restored to that
mortal state.

Morianton 2:48
 48 And as this mortal shall rise again, and all flesh shall be
restored to that mortal state, so we know, because of the resurrection of
the body, that the resurrection of the body shall also come
to those who have been fallen, that is, to everyone.

Morianton 2:49
 49 Now, the resurrection of the body accords with the plan of
redeemed immortality; for as the body is changed from the
death of the flesh to the life of the flesh, from the unchangeable
death of the body to the life of the body--and all this
concreteness of the resurrection--so also is the resurrection
concreted from the fall.

Morianton 2:50
 50 And now, the plan of restored man to the mortal body is
expedient to be explained in this record, for the preparation of
the flesh for burial is completed; and the unchangeable parts of
the body, which have not the form of flesh, are brought
forth in the resurrection, according to the flesh, which is the
mortal body.

Morianton 2:51
 51 And now, this restoreth the body to the mortal body, which
is the death of the flesh, in the resurrection, which brought
forth the body after the manner of death, that the flesh might
be restored to the body; that is, restored unto the corruption of
the flesh, that the corruptible might be restored to the incorruptible state,
that the plan of restoration might be fulfilled.

Morianton 2:52
 52 But, behold, I will explain the resurrection of the body,
that the corruption of the flesh and the resurrection of the body,
which is the life of the flesh, may be accomplished in the
defiant vessel of death.

Morianton 2:53
 53 And now behold, I will state distinctly the plan of death, which
was proposed by the devil, which was prepared from the
fall of Adam, whereby he should raise upon himself the form of a
king over all the earth; and if he should slay he should be raised up in
his own kingdom; for this cause the devil hath devised to destroy
the flesh.

Morianton 2:54
 54 Now it came to pass that the first man that sought power over the
children of men sought also to destroy the flesh; for at the
judgment-seat of the flesh he marred the image of the Lord,
which had been made flesh, of whom hath the image been
made flesh.

Morianton 2:55
 55 Behold, the image 2:49
 49 Now, the resurrection of the body accords with the plan of
redeemed immortality; for as the body is changed from the
death of the flesh to the life of the flesh, from the unchangeable
death of the body to the life of the body--and all this
concreteness of the resurrection--so also is the resurrection
concreted from the fall.

Morianton 2:50
 50 And now, the plan of restored man to the mortal body is
expedient to be explained in this record, for the preparation of
the flesh for burial is completed; and the unchangeable parts of
the body, which have not the form of flesh, are brought
forth in the resurrection, according to the flesh, which is the
mortal body.

Morianton 2:51
 51 And now, this restoreth the body to the mortal body, which
is the death of the flesh, in the resurrection, which brought
forth the body after the manner of death, that the flesh might
be restored to the body; that is, restored unto the corruption of
the flesh, that the corruptible might be restored to the incorruptible state,
that the plan of restoration might be fulfilled.

Morianton 2:52
 52 But, behold, I will explain the resurrection of the body,
that the corruption of the flesh and the resurrection of the body,
which is the life of the flesh, may be accomplished in the
defiant vessel of death.

Morianton 2:53
 53 And now behold, I will state distinctly the plan of death, which
was proposed by the devil, which was prepared from the
fall of Adam, whereby he should raise upon himself the form of a
king over all the earth; and if he should slay he should be raised up in
his own kingdom; for this cause the devil hath devised to destroy
the flesh.

Morianton 2:54
 54 Now it came to pass that the first man that sought power over the
children of men sought also to destroy the flesh; for at the
judgment-seat of the flesh he marred the image of the Lord,
which had been made flesh, of whom hath the image been
made flesh.

Morianton 2:55
 55 Behold, the image of the Lord hath been made flesh. Now
behold, at this time, the kingdom of the devil had no
power over them, therefore they were not subject to the law;
for they were not under the law.

Morianton 2:56
 56 Therefore, the devil hath said unto them: Behold, I make bare the
faces of your masters for you that have been spoken of by us;
and perhaps thou wilt remember our words which I have spoken.

Morianton 2:57
 57 Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever is unwilling to
remember the words which I have spoken, him will I cut off from the
face of the earth; and I will be merciful unto him, that he
may not remember me.

Morianton 2:58
 58 Therefore I say unto you, that I will be merciful unto him, that
he may not remember me.

Morianton 2:59
 59 And I say unto you, that as I have taught my people
from the beginning, even so I will teach them from this time forward,
until the kingdom of the devil shall be fulfilled. Amen.

Morianton 3
Chapter 3

Morianton 3:1
 1 Behold, I, Morianton, have written the records which have
been kept by our fathers, according to that which was written by
the prophets, from that time forth; therefore they are called
prophecies.

Morianton 3:2
 2 And they are written upon the plates of brass; and they are
written in the record which is kept by the priests of the
Lord, from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem until this
time.

Morianton 3:3
 3 Behold, it came to pass that they were written upon the
plates of brass, and also upon the plates of Nephi; for behold, the more
knowable of the holy order, the more holy records which are kept by
the priests of the Lord, are upon the plates of brass.

Morianton 3:4
 4 And they are written according to that which is written by the
holy prophets, from that time forth; and the more knowable
of the holy records, the more holy records which are kept by the
priests are upon the plates of Nephi; and they are called
interpreters.

Morianton 3:5
 5 And they arethe image of the Lord hath been made flesh. Now
behold, at this time, the kingdom of the devil had no
power over them, therefore they were not subject to the law;
for they were not under the law.

Morianton 2:56
 56 Therefore, the devil hath said unto them: Behold, I make bare the
faces of your masters for you that have been spoken of by us;
and perhaps thou wilt remember our words which I have spoken.

Morianton 2:57
 57 Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever is unwilling to
remember the words which I have spoken, him will I cut off from the
face of the earth; and I will be merciful unto him, that he
may not remember me.

Morianton 2:58
 58 Therefore I say unto you, that I will be merciful unto him, that
he may not remember me.

Morianton 2:59
 59 And I say unto you, that as I have taught my people
from the beginning, even so I will teach them from this time forward,
until the kingdom of the devil shall be fulfilled. Amen.

Morianton 3
Chapter 3

Morianton 3:1
 1 Behold, I, Morianton, have written the records which have
been kept by our fathers, according to that which was written by
the prophets, from that time forth; therefore they are called
prophecies.

Morianton 3:2
 2 And they are written upon the plates of brass; and they are
written in the record which is kept by the priests of the
Lord, from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem until this
time.

Morianton 3:3
 3 Behold, it came to pass that they were written upon the
plates of brass, and also upon the plates of Nephi; for behold, the more
knowable of the holy order, the more holy records which are kept by
the priests of the Lord, are upon the plates of brass.

Morianton 3:4
 4 And they are written according to that which is written by the
holy prophets, from that time forth; and the more knowable
of the holy records, the more holy records which are kept by the
priests are upon the plates of Nephi; and they are called
interpreters.

Morianton 3:5
 5 And they are holy records, and they have been handed down
from one generation to another for the express purpose of
keeping them, from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem until this
time, that thereby they might keep the records which were
kept by them from generation to generation.

Morianton 3:6
 6 And behold, I further tell you that the priests of the
Lord, and also all those who are called by his holy order,
have also kept the record which was kept by them from
generation to generation.

Morianton 3:7
 7 And it came to pass that they were desirous to learn of
the Lord what things had been done in the matter of their
fathers.

Morianton 3:8
 8 And it came to pass that Moroni began from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem, being a young man in the days of
iniquity; yea, a man who was a descendant of Joseph, who was
the son of Jacob; therefore, a descendant of Joseph.

Morianton 3:9
 9 Yea, he was a descendant of Joseph; but he was a man of his times,
and also of his age; therefore, he was desirous to know concerning the
death of the chief judge, who had been chosen by the people of the
land.

Morianton 3:10
 10 And it came to pass that he inquired of the Lord, saying:
Will thy people, who have been slain by the hand of this
man, live to see him that hath put his trust in them--that
shall they live to see him that hath put his trust in them? Behold,
I say unto you, Nay.

Morianton 3:11
 11 And he said unto the Lord: If they so live, they shall see
him that hath put his trust in them; and if they so live, they
shall see him that hath put his trust in them.

Morianton 3:12
 12 And thus ended the words of Morianton.

Morianton 4
Chapter 4

Morianton 4:1
 1 Behold, it came to pass that in the latter end of the
twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi, there were two hundred and thirty andnd they are called
interpreters.

Morianton 3:5
 5 And they are holy records, and they have been handed down
from one generation to another for the express purpose of
keeping them, from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem until this
time, that thereby they might keep the records which were
kept by them from generation to generation.

Morianton 3:6
 6 And behold, I further tell you that the priests of the
Lord, and also all those who are called by his holy order,
have also kept the record which was kept by them from
generation to generation.

Morianton 3:7
 7 And it came to pass that they were desirous to learn of
the Lord what things had been done in the matter of their
fathers.

Morianton 3:8
 8 And it came to pass that Moroni began from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem, being a young man in the days of
iniquity; yea, a man who was a descendant of Joseph, who was
the son of Jacob; therefore, a descendant of Joseph.

Morianton 3:9
 9 Yea, he was a descendant of Joseph; but he was a man of his times,
and also of his age; therefore, he was desirous to know concerning the
death of the chief judge, who had been chosen by the people of the
land.

Morianton 3:10
 10 And it came to pass that he inquired of the Lord, saying:
Will thy people, who have been slain by the hand of this
man, live to see him that hath put his trust in them--that
shall they live to see him that hath put his trust in them? Behold,
I say unto you, Nay.

Morianton 3:11
 11 And he said unto the Lord: If they so live, they shall see
him that hath put his trust in them; and if they so live, they
shall see him that hath put his trust in them.

Morianton 3:12
 12 And thus ended the words of Morianton.

Morianton 4
Chapter 4

Morianton 4:1
 1 Behold, it came to pass that in the latter end of the
twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi, there were two hundred and thirty and three years
had passed away since the captivity of Lehi.

Morianton 4:2
 2 And in the commencement of the twenty and seventh year of
the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni had
moved from the land of Ammonihah to the land which was at
Jerusalem, which was called Jerusalem--

Morianton 4:3
 3 Having established by the hand of the Lord a church in the
west of the land of Ammonihah, and also by the hand of the
Lord, a church, having their privileges of worship, and freedom
from taxes, and from all manner of burdens, which were laid
upon their shoulders by the people of the land; Therefore, being in the
promised land, they were desirous to come down unto the land
which was in the city of Jerusalem.

Morianton 4:4
 4 But Moroni said unto them: Behold, the Lord will not suffer that
they shall not come down unto the land, which is in the city.

Morianton 4:5
 5 But he will give unto them unto them that they may know concerning
their brethren who are in the city; for behold, the Lord
proceedeth soon, every one to meet his God in the gate.

Morianton 4:6
 6 Wherefore, Moroni caused that Lehi and a small number of his
people should gather together their lands, their women, and their
children, the cattle, and the grain of their fields, and all manner
of flocks of wild beasts;

Morianton 4:7
 7 And depart into the wilderness, which is northward, and
depart thence into the wilderness, which is southward; for behold, the Lord
proceedeth in wisdom among the people.

Morianton 4:8
 8 And Moroni caused that his people, being in the days of
Zoram, and having a voice, should depart into the wilderness,
which is southward.

Morianton 4:9
 9 And Moroni took Teancum, and caused that he should be
placed in the stead of Lehi.

Morianton 4:10
 10 And even this same man, having named him after his
father, being hearkening to the words of hisd and thirty and three years
had passed away since the captivity of Lehi.

Morianton 4:2
 2 And in the commencement of the twenty and seventh year of
the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni had
moved from the land of Ammonihah to the land which was at
Jerusalem, which was called Jerusalem--

Morianton 4:3
 3 Having established by the hand of the Lord a church in the
west of the land of Ammonihah, and also by the hand of the
Lord, a church, having their privileges of worship, and freedom
from taxes, and from all manner of burdens, which were laid
upon their shoulders by the people of the land; Therefore, being in the
promised land, they were desirous to come down unto the land
which was in the city of Jerusalem.

Morianton 4:4
 4 But Moroni said unto them: Behold, the Lord will not suffer that
they shall not come down unto the land, which is in the city.

Morianton 4:5
 5 But he will give unto them unto them that they may know concerning
their brethren who are in the city; for behold, the Lord
proceedeth soon, every one to meet his God in the gate.

Morianton 4:6
 6 Wherefore, Moroni caused that Lehi and a small number of his
people should gather together their lands, their women, and their
children, the cattle, and the grain of their fields, and all manner
of flocks of wild beasts;

Morianton 4:7
 7 And depart into the wilderness, which is northward, and
depart thence into the wilderness, which is southward; for behold, the Lord
proceedeth in wisdom among the people.

Morianton 4:8
 8 And Moroni caused that his people, being in the days of
Zoram, and having a voice, should depart into the wilderness,
which is southward.

Morianton 4:9
 9 And Moroni took Teancum, and caused that he should be
placed in the stead of Lehi.

Morianton 4:10
 10 And even this same man, having named him after his
father, being hearkening to the words of his father, being
baptized by the hand of Moroni, saying: Behold, I am a child of
the Lord; therefore, have faith, O Lord, and keep my commandments.

Morianton 4:11
 11 And he was never seen nor heard of againe by the
people of Nephi.

Morianton 4:12
 12 And Moroni, being desirous to know of the return of those
who had been lost, went forth among them, enquiring of the
Lord whither they had been taken.

Morianton 4:13
 13 And they said unto him: They have been lost for the
space of many years; and we know but little concerning
them; and also, we know that they are desirous to know the
return of our children, that they may be found whither we have been
trapped.

Morianton 4:14
 14 Wherefore, the Lord promised unto us that he would bring them
again out of the wilderness; and also, he promised unto us that he
would show unto them concerning the destruction of our children, that
they must surely come forth out of the wilderness.

Morianton 4:15
 15 But behold, the Lord said unto us that the Lord prophesied unto
him that he should make a way for our children through the wilderness;
and also, that they must not perish by hunger, nor thirst, nor
fatigue, nor any manner of sickness.

Morianton 4:16
 16 And when Moroni had said these words, the people began to
exceed him in faith, and began to pray and supplicating in the name of
their God, for their safety.

Morianton 4:17
 17 And they did raise their voices, yea, all were loud, yea,
evening on, every word which he spake.

Moroni 4:18
 18 And he began to teach them the words of the Lord, which
were given by Alma, and also the words of his father, in
the presence of many witnesses, who testified of him, according to the
things which they had seen, and also of the things which they had
hearkened unto.

Morianton 4:19
 19 And it came to pass that he began to teach them
the coming of Christ; and he also began to teach them concerning
the restoration ofized by the hand of Moroni, saying: Behold, I am a child of
the Lord; therefore, have faith, O Lord, and keep my commandments.

Morianton 4:11
 11 And he was never seen nor heard of againe by the
people of Nephi.

Morianton 4:12
 12 And Moroni, being desirous to know of the return of those
who had been lost, went forth among them, enquiring of the
Lord whither they had been taken.

Morianton 4:13
 13 And they said unto him: They have been lost for the
space of many years; and we know but little concerning
them; and also, we know that they are desirous to know the
return of our children, that they may be found whither we have been
trapped.

Morianton 4:14
 14 Wherefore, the Lord promised unto us that he would bring them
again out of the wilderness; and also, he promised unto us that he
would show unto them concerning the destruction of our children, that
they must surely come forth out of the wilderness.

Morianton 4:15
 15 But behold, the Lord said unto us that the Lord prophesied unto
him that he should make a way for our children through the wilderness;
and also, that they must not perish by hunger, nor thirst, nor
fatigue, nor any manner of sickness.

Morianton 4:16
 16 And when Moroni had said these words, the people began to
exceed him in faith, and began to pray and supplicating in the name of
their God, for their safety.

Morianton 4:17
 17 And they did raise their voices, yea, all were loud, yea,
evening on, every word which he spake.

Moroni 4:18
 18 And he began to teach them the words of the Lord, which
were given by Alma, and also the words of his father, in
the presence of many witnesses, who testified of him, according to the
things which they had seen, and also of the things which they had
hearkened unto.

Morianton 4:19
 19 And it came to pass that he began to teach them
the coming of Christ; and he also began to teach them concerning
the restoration of their children.

Morianton 4:20
 20 And he began to teach them concerning the covenants which
they had made, which they had made to the Lord, and also concerning
their children.

Morianton 4:21
 21 And he began to teach them concerning the creation of
earth and of all things which were in the earth; and he began
to teach them concerning the flood of waters which fell upon
the waters, which made the waves great; wherefore, the earth
was rolled together as the wind, and the water became
mighty, and did fill the heavens and did become a whirlwind.

Morianton 4:22
 22 And he began to teach them concerning the creation of the
winds and the rain of fire and of smoke which followed it;
and also concerning the day, that is, from the time that the flood
oftened its borders, until that time, the voice of the
Lord came unto them, saying:

Morianton 4:23
 23 Behold, I, Morianton, having been commanded of the Father to
speak unto you, behold, I have not said any thing which is written
concerning this thing; but whatsoever I have said, it hath
been done. Therefore, go forth and finish the record, which ye have
made with your own hands.

Morianton 4:24
 24 For if ye have not a proper title, ye can write it; for it
shall be remembered by the children of men.

Morianton 4:25
 25 But behold, I have not written anything which I should suffer
to write; neither am I weak, for I am but a man, and my words
must be judged according to their fruits.

Morianton 4:26
 26 And behold, I have done this that a man might know of me,
that a man might know of the workmanship of my scroll, which I
have made with my own hands.

Morianton 4:27
 27 Behold, I know the workmanship of my scroll, and it is good;
and I know the time that it must be made, that it should be made
according to the time that it is to be found, which is the
fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Nephi.

Morianton 4:28
 28 Behold, Iildren.

Morianton 4:20
 20 And he began to teach them concerning the covenants which
they had made, which they had made to the Lord, and also concerning
their children.

Morianton 4:21
 21 And he began to teach them concerning the creation of
earth and of all things which were in the earth; and he began
to teach them concerning the flood of waters which fell upon
the waters, which made the waves great; wherefore, the earth
was rolled together as the wind, and the water became
mighty, and did fill the heavens and did become a whirlwind.

Morianton 4:22
 22 And he began to teach them concerning the creation of the
winds and the rain of fire and of smoke which followed it;
and also concerning the day, that is, from the time that the flood
oftened its borders, until that time, the voice of the
Lord came unto them, saying:

Morianton 4:23
 23 Behold, I, Morianton, having been commanded of the Father to
speak unto you, behold, I have not said any thing which is written
concerning this thing; but whatsoever I have said, it hath
been done. Therefore, go forth and finish the record, which ye have
made with your own hands.

Morianton 4:24
 24 For if ye have not a proper title, ye can write it; for it
shall be remembered by the children of men.

Morianton 4:25
 25 But behold, I have not written anything which I should suffer
to write; neither am I weak, for I am but a man, and my words
must be judged according to their fruits.

Morianton 4:26
 26 And behold, I have done this that a man might know of me,
that a man might know of the workmanship of my scroll, which I
have made with my own hands.

Morianton 4:27
 27 Behold, I know the workmanship of my scroll, and it is good;
and I know the time that it must be made, that it should be made
according to the time that it is to be found, which is the
fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Nephi.

Morianton 4:28
 28 Behold, I know the workmanship of your plates; and it
is sound; and it is the workmanship of the finest
gold.

Morianton 4:29
 29 And behold, I know the workmanship of your head-plates,
which are the works of your brain.

Morianton 4:30
 30 And behold, I know of a surety your faith is sufficient for
me, for ye have taught me that ye could not write the
words which I have written.

Morianton 4:31
 31 And behold, I know of a surety that ye would make it a
part of this book, that I might know that ye knew that I
had written the things which I have written.

Morianton 4:32
 32 And now, my son, I know that if I had known these things
I should not have written them. I do not write them upon
plates, but I write them upon the board, and behold they
are written upon the plates of brass; for behold, they have been
written with the intent that they should be kept and
permitted to be delivered up unto the child of men; that the
child of men should know of the things which they had
permitted to be written.

Morianton 4:33
 33 Yea, my son, I know that if I had known these things
I should have written them. Yea, I know that I should have
written them.

Morianton 4:34
 34 But behold, the Lord hath said that I should not write them,
and he hath commanded me that I should deliver them up unto my
children.

Morianton 4:35
 35 And now, my son, these things have been forbidden; and
notwithstanding I have obeyed the commandments, I have
spent the greater part of my days in the wilderness,
in the wilderness of the wilderness of the people of Nephi.

Morianton 4:36
 36 And it came to pass that I have searched the records,
that I have done that which was commanded of the Father.
And I have not found the things which I desired; for
they are not written in this book. And I know that once
the record has been found it cannot be written again;
wherefore, I have sealed it up.

Morianton 4:37
 37 And itehold, I know the workmanship of your plates; and it
is sound; and it is the workmanship of the finest
gold.

Morianton 4:29
 29 And behold, I know the workmanship of your head-plates,
which are the works of your brain.

Morianton 4:30
 30 And behold, I know of a surety your faith is sufficient for
me, for ye have taught me that ye could not write the
words which I have written.

Morianton 4:31
 31 And behold, I know of a surety that ye would make it a
part of this book, that I might know that ye knew that I
had written the things which I have written.

Morianton 4:32
 32 And now, my son, I know that if I had known these things
I should not have written them. I do not write them upon
plates, but I write them upon the board, and behold they
are written upon the plates of brass; for behold, they have been
written with the intent that they should be kept and
permitted to be delivered up unto the child of men; that the
child of men should know of the things which they had
permitted to be written.

Morianton 4:33
 33 Yea, my son, I know that if I had known these things
I should have written them. Yea, I know that I should have
written them.

Morianton 4:34
 34 But behold, the Lord hath said that I should not write them,
and he hath commanded me that I should deliver them up unto my
children.

Morianton 4:35
 35 And now, my son, these things have been forbidden; and
notwithstanding I have obeyed the commandments, I have
spent the greater part of my days in the wilderness,
in the wilderness of the wilderness of the people of Nephi.

Morianton 4:36
 36 And it came to pass that I have searched the records,
that I have done that which was commanded of the Father.
And I have not found the things which I desired; for
they are not written in this book. And I know that once
the record has been found it cannot be written again;
wherefore, I have sealed it up.

Morianton 4:37
 37 And it came to pass that I did make plates of mine own
earth, which contained the record of my people from the time
of their coming down out of the land of Jerusalem.

Morianton 5
Chapter 5

Morianton 5:1
 1 Behold, I, Morianton, do make a record of my people, according
to that which is written. Behold, I make a record of my
people from the time of their coming down out of the land
of Jerusalem until the time they left thence. And I make a
record of the prophecies of the holy prophets which have
been spoken by the prophets, from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem until the time he left again.

Morianton 5:2
 2 And now, my son, I must answer a few questions which are
prepared by this people, that they may know concerning those
who went down into the wilderness to flee the wrath of the
judgment-seat of God.

Morianton 5:3
 3 Behold, I am a man; and I have written the commandments of
God upon plates of brass; wherefore, if God should speak
unto me, and showed me that I had written them, I should
return to the plates of brass, and behold the writing
thereon which I had written.

Morianton 5:4
 4 And it came to pass that after I had read the commandments
thereof, I returned to the plates of brass, and did read
them; and the writing thereon which I had shown unto him,
which was of the gold and of the precious things which
were thereon, did delight him again in the things of which he had
beheld.

Morianton 5:5
 5 And it came to pass that he wrote again the account of the
things which he had seen; and he also did make a record of the
transgressor; for behold, he had translated the records which
had been handed down from one generation to another,
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 5:6
 6 And he also made a record of the righteous destruction of
the people who had been brought out of the land of Jerusalem,
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 5:7
 7 And he also brought forth the plates of Nephi; andat I did make plates of mine own
earth, which contained the record of my people from the time
of their coming down out of the land of Jerusalem.

Morianton 5
Chapter 5

Morianton 5:1
 1 Behold, I, Morianton, do make a record of my people, according
to that which is written. Behold, I make a record of my
people from the time of their coming down out of the land
of Jerusalem until the time they left thence. And I make a
record of the prophecies of the holy prophets which have
been spoken by the prophets, from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem until the time he left again.

Morianton 5:2
 2 And now, my son, I must answer a few questions which are
prepared by this people, that they may know concerning those
who went down into the wilderness to flee the wrath of the
judgment-seat of God.

Morianton 5:3
 3 Behold, I am a man; and I have written the commandments of
God upon plates of brass; wherefore, if God should speak
unto me, and showed me that I had written them, I should
return to the plates of brass, and behold the writing
thereon which I had written.

Morianton 5:4
 4 And it came to pass that after I had read the commandments
thereof, I returned to the plates of brass, and did read
them; and the writing thereon which I had shown unto him,
which was of the gold and of the precious things which
were thereon, did delight him again in the things of which he had
beheld.

Morianton 5:5
 5 And it came to pass that he wrote again the account of the
things which he had seen; and he also did make a record of the
transgressor; for behold, he had translated the records which
had been handed down from one generation to another,
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 5:6
 6 And he also made a record of the righteous destruction of
the people who had been brought out of the land of Jerusalem,
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 5:7
 7 And he also brought forth the plates of Nephi; and
he did engraven upon them the record of the righteous destruction of
the people who had been brought out of the land of Jerusalem,
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 5:8
 8 And after this manner did he engraven the record of
the righteous destruction of his people, to prepare the way for
the return of his people unto the land of their inheritance.

Morianton 5:9
 9 Wherefore, he commanded his people that they should bring
them forth unto the people. And it came to pass that they
began to bring forth the records, according to the
words of Nephi; and to his astonishment, and also the people of
Nephi, behold, there arose a great contention among them;
yea, even so much so that when they were come to the
knowledge of the righteous destruction of their people, they
began to be suspicious concerning the words which had been spoken by
their prophet.

Morianton 5:10
 10 Nevertheless, Morianton, fearing the people would faint in
the wilderness, he caused a division among them.

Morianton 5:11
 11 Therefore, he caused that a division should arise among them;
yea, he caused that a division should arise among them, to
prepare the way for the return of his people.

Morianton 5:12
 12 Wherefore, he caused likewise that a new record should be
made, according to the words of Nephi; and it was a record which
had been brought forth by the prophet Alma, who also was a descendant
of Nephi.

Morianton 5:13
 13 And it came to pass that Morianton caused that the
words of Alma should be read to the people; and after they had
received much revelation from God, they also were desirous that the
records should be preserved.

Morianton 5:14
 14 Nevertheless, Morianton caused that they should be taken and
made manifest unto the people; and this he did that he might
preserve the records which had been brought forth by the
prophet Alma, which contained the sacred things of the
people of Nephi.

Morianton 5:15
 15 Wherefore, Morianton made another record, which was a
records which had been obtained by the fraud of the
diabolical king Mosiah,f
the people who had been brought out of the land of Jerusalem,
according to the word of the Lord.

Morianton 5:8
 8 And after this manner did he engraven the record of
the righteous destruction of his people, to prepare the way for
the return of his people unto the land of their inheritance.

Morianton 5:9
 9 Wherefore, he commanded his people that they should bring
them forth unto the people. And it came to pass that they
began to bring forth the records, according to the
words of Nephi; and to his astonishment, and also the people of
Nephi, behold, there arose a great contention among them;
yea, even so much so that when they were come to the
knowledge of the righteous destruction of their people, they
began to be suspicious concerning the words which had been spoken by
their prophet.

Morianton 5:10
 10 Nevertheless, Morianton, fearing the people would faint in
the wilderness, he caused a division among them.

Morianton 5:11
 11 Therefore, he caused that a division should arise among them;
yea, he caused that a division should arise among them, to
prepare the way for the return of his people.

Morianton 5:12
 12 Wherefore, he caused likewise that a new record should be
made, according to the words of Nephi; and it was a record which
had been brought forth by the prophet Alma, who also was a descendant
of Nephi.

Morianton 5:13
 13 And it came to pass that Morianton caused that the
words of Alma should be read to the people; and after they had
received much revelation from God, they also were desirous that the
records should be preserved.

Morianton 5:14
 14 Nevertheless, Morianton caused that they should be taken and
made manifest unto the people; and this he did that he might
preserve the records which had been brought forth by the
prophet Alma, which contained the sacred things of the
people of Nephi.

Morianton 5:15
 15 Wherefore, Morianton made another record, which was a
records which had been obtained by the fraud of the
diabolical king Mosiah, who was the son of Alma, or who had
been the son of Alma, who created the kingdom of his father,
and who hid up the records which had been obtained by the
hiding of the records which had been obtained by fraud.

Morianton 5:16
 16 These things he did because he had obtained the power of
translation; for he was desirous that the records should be
translated into our language, that he could bring them forth
unto the people, that he might know the course of his people.

Morianton 5:17
 17 But behold, Alma and his people would not that he should be
expedient that he should translate the records; for behold,
they were in the wilderness; and also the records which had
been obtained by fraud were in the houses of Mosiah and
Amulek.

Morianton 5:18
 18 And it came to pass that Alma and his people would have them
translated out of the land, if it were possible.

Morianton 5:19
 19 But Alma would have them not, for he was a man of God,
being called of God, having been brought by the power of God out of
the land of Jerusalem, being carried out of the land of
Jerusalem by the power and authority of God among his people.

Morianton 5:20
 20 Yea, even among his people. But he being a man of God,
having been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and stripped of
his body, and blood, and shame, and guilt, he did put on incorruptible
body and spirit, and went forth upon the face of the land, even
until he had brought forth all the records which had been
translated from the languages which had been destroyed because of
their iniquity, which were in the wilderness.

Morianton 5:21
 21 And he did this by the power of his word alone, by the power of
the spirit of prophecy which was in him, which was a gift
of God, and he did not tarry in translating all the records
which had been lost because of their iniquity.

Morianton 5:22
 22 And now Morianton did translate all the records which had
been lost; and he put them together in one place.

Morianton 5:23
 23 And he did this because he wasas the son of Alma, or who had
been the son of Alma, who created the kingdom of his father,
and who hid up the records which had been obtained by the
hiding of the records which had been obtained by fraud.

Morianton 5:16
 16 These things he did because he had obtained the power of
translation; for he was desirous that the records should be
translated into our language, that he could bring them forth
unto the people, that he might know the course of his people.

Morianton 5:17
 17 But behold, Alma and his people would not that he should be
expedient that he should translate the records; for behold,
they were in the wilderness; and also the records which had
been obtained by fraud were in the houses of Mosiah and
Amulek.

Morianton 5:18
 18 And it came to pass that Alma and his people would have them
translated out of the land, if it were possible.

Morianton 5:19
 19 But Alma would have them not, for he was a man of God,
being called of God, having been brought by the power of God out of
the land of Jerusalem, being carried out of the land of
Jerusalem by the power and authority of God among his people.

Morianton 5:20
 20 Yea, even among his people. But he being a man of God,
having been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and stripped of
his body, and blood, and shame, and guilt, he did put on incorruptible
body and spirit, and went forth upon the face of the land, even
until he had brought forth all the records which had been
translated from the languages which had been destroyed because of
their iniquity, which were in the wilderness.

Morianton 5:21
 21 And he did this by the power of his word alone, by the power of
the spirit of prophecy which was in him, which was a gift
of God, and he did not tarry in translating all the records
which had been lost because of their iniquity.

Morianton 5:22
 22 And now Morianton did translate all the records which had
been lost; and he put them together in one place.

Morianton 5:23
 23 And he did this because he was commanded, and he did this
because of the many revelations which he had received.

Morianton 5:24
 24 And now, when he had brought forth all this, he
began to prophesy upon the reverse of the plates; for he
began to prophesy concerning his father, even that he should
be slain, and the records which should be engraven upon them,
which should be kept and kept in the holy scriptures, even
until the day of judgment.

Morianton 5:25
 25 Wherefore, Morianton, as he went forth among his people
to declare unto them the records and the holy scriptures which had
been delivered unto them by Alma and his brethren, the voice of
the Spirit came unto him, saying:

Morianton 5:26
 26 Behold, these records and scriptures are not hid from the
knowledge of the Lord, but the Lord knows all things
concerning them; wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to deliver them
up unto you.

Morianton 5:27
 27 Therefore, thus saith the Spirit, thou shalt do this in my name
to-give unto them, unto whomever I shall think fit.

Morianton 5:28
 28 And it came to pass that Alma and his people began to
discover among the people that there must needs be a Messiah
before the Messiah could come, since all the
concubines and the adulterers could not be chastened enough; for
there was no discipline among the people.

Morianton 5:29
 29 Nevertheless, Alma did teach the people, by the power of the
revelations, that there should be a Messiah, a Savior of the
world, and this that all men should know of him and come unto him, or
none else should know him at all.

Morianton 5:30
 30 And thus it came to pass that when they had all come unto
him, Alma, and his people, they did acknowledge him, and declare
him to be God, and said that there was no other God; and that
there could be no redemption brought upon the children of
men save it should be through him, and that he should
repent.

Morianton 5:31
 31 But Alma repented not, saying: I know that I am a man
 he did this because he was commanded, and he did this
because of the many revelations which he had received.

Morianton 5:24
 24 And now, when he had brought forth all this, he
began to prophesy upon the reverse of the plates; for he
began to prophesy concerning his father, even that he should
be slain, and the records which should be engraven upon them,
which should be kept and kept in the holy scriptures, even
until the day of judgment.

Morianton 5:25
 25 Wherefore, Morianton, as he went forth among his people
to declare unto them the records and the holy scriptures which had
been delivered unto them by Alma and his brethren, the voice of
the Spirit came unto him, saying:

Morianton 5:26
 26 Behold, these records and scriptures are not hid from the
knowledge of the Lord, but the Lord knows all things
concerning them; wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to deliver them
up unto you.

Morianton 5:27
 27 Therefore, thus saith the Spirit, thou shalt do this in my name
to-give unto them, unto whomever I shall think fit.

Morianton 5:28
 28 And it came to pass that Alma and his people began to
discover among the people that there must needs be a Messiah
before the Messiah could come, since all the
concubines and the adulterers could not be chastened enough; for
there was no discipline among the people.

Morianton 5:29
 29 Nevertheless, Alma did teach the people, by the power of the
revelations, that there should be a Messiah, a Savior of the
world, and this that all men should know of him and come unto him, or
none else should know him at all.

Morianton 5:30
 30 And thus it came to pass that when they had all come unto
him, Alma, and his people, they did acknowledge him, and declare
him to be God, and said that there was no other God; and that
there could be no redemption brought upon the children of
men save it should be through him, and that he should
repent.

Morianton 5:31
 31 But Alma repented not, saying: I know that I am a man
created in the beginning, and I cannot remember the things of my
birth, because of the many revelations which I have received
concerning my father.

Morianton 5:32
 32 I know that God is merciful unto me, and that he hath commanded
me that I should remember his holy command, even unto the best
of my memory.

Morianton 5:33
 33 But behold, I know that I am a man, and I am led away by the
Spirit, even to the retention of that which shall be
saved.

Morianton 5:34
 34 And the thing which shall be saved is that which shall be
done away.

Morianton 5:35
 35 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did commence
the restoration of the records and the holy scriptures which had
been delivered unto them by Alma and his people.

Morianton 5:36
 36 And Morianton, being a man of God, being called by the Spirit
to bring forth the records which had been kept by the people
of the people of Nephi, which had been delivered unto them by the hand of
Alma and his people; and these things he did.

Morianton 5:37
 37 And it came to pass that Morianton began to prophesy unto the
People of Nephi concerning the restoration of their records.

Morianton 6
Chapter 6

Morianton 6:1
 1 Now Alma and Abinadi had built up many cities by the
seashore, even in the borders of the land which was divided from
the land of Zarahemla;

Morianton 6:2
 2 And they also had built up many temples, many of which
were in the borders of the land which was divided from the land
of Zarahemla.

Morianton 6:3
 3 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did build
temples in all the land round about, on the east of the city
of Zarahemla; and they did build many temples in the city
of Morianton, which was in the borders round about on the
south.

Morianton 6:4
 4 And it came to pass that they did build many mighty
temples in all the land round about, which did burn with fire
with exceedinglya repented not, saying: I know that I am a man
created in the beginning, and I cannot remember the things of my
birth, because of the many revelations which I have received
concerning my father.

Morianton 5:32
 32 I know that God is merciful unto me, and that he hath commanded
me that I should remember his holy command, even unto the best
of my memory.

Morianton 5:33
 33 But behold, I know that I am a man, and I am led away by the
Spirit, even to the retention of that which shall be
saved.

Morianton 5:34
 34 And the thing which shall be saved is that which shall be
done away.

Morianton 5:35
 35 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did commence
the restoration of the records and the holy scriptures which had
been delivered unto them by Alma and his people.

Morianton 5:36
 36 And Morianton, being a man of God, being called by the Spirit
to bring forth the records which had been kept by the people
of the people of Nephi, which had been delivered unto them by the hand of
Alma and his people; and these things he did.

Morianton 5:37
 37 And it came to pass that Morianton began to prophesy unto the
People of Nephi concerning the restoration of their records.

Morianton 6
Chapter 6

Morianton 6:1
 1 Now Alma and Abinadi had built up many cities by the
seashore, even in the borders of the land which was divided from
the land of Zarahemla;

Morianton 6:2
 2 And they also had built up many temples, many of which
were in the borders of the land which was divided from the land
of Zarahemla.

Morianton 6:3
 3 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did build
temples in all the land round about, on the east of the city
of Zarahemla; and they did build many temples in the city
of Morianton, which was in the borders round about on the
south.

Morianton 6:4
 4 And it came to pass that they did build many mighty
temples in all the land round about, which did burn with fire
with exceedingly great magnificence; and it came to pass that they
did magnify the records which had been delivered unto them by the
hand of Alma.

Morianton 6:5
 5 And they also built many mighty works of wood, and of
iron, and of gold, and of silver, and of refined metal.

Morianton 6:6
 6 And behold, their works were like unto all those
which had been done by the people of the Lord, which had
been in the land of Zarahemla.

Morianton 6:7
 7 And the city of Morianton did glory in the days of Alma and
his people, even as did the city of Morianton in the
days of Alma and his people.

Morianton 6:8
 8 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did go forth
among the people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ;
and they did also that of their fathers before them.

Morianton 6:9
 9 And in the days of Alma and his people they were persecuted
more abundantly by the Nephites, for they were desirous to be
consigned a state of innocence, that they might be raised up in the
carnal state, to inherit the kingdom of God.

Morianton 6:10
 10 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did distinguish
themselves from all the people, that they were called the people of
God.

Morianton 6:11
 11 And it came to pass that when they had thus been distinguished
beyond that of the people, they were scourged by the people of
Nephi, because of the great wickedness of the people of the
Church, which was established in the days of the
Messiah, yea, and also the secret combinations which were
built up among the people;

Morianton 6:12
 12 And also because of their many iniquities, which they
had committed, and because of the many murders which were
wrought upon the people--

Morianton 6:13
 13 Therefore, the people of Alma, and also those of the
people of Zarahemla, and also of Fomor, the son of Alma,
and also the people of about, which did burn with fire
with exceedingly great magnificence; and it came to pass that they
did magnify the records which had been delivered unto them by the
hand of Alma.

Morianton 6:5
 5 And they also built many mighty works of wood, and of
iron, and of gold, and of silver, and of refined metal.

Morianton 6:6
 6 And behold, their works were like unto all those
which had been done by the people of the Lord, which had
been in the land of Zarahemla.

Morianton 6:7
 7 And the city of Morianton did glory in the days of Alma and
his people, even as did the city of Morianton in the
days of Alma and his people.

Morianton 6:8
 8 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did go forth
among the people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ;
and they did also that of their fathers before them.

Morianton 6:9
 9 And in the days of Alma and his people they were persecuted
more abundantly by the Nephites, for they were desirous to be
consigned a state of innocence, that they might be raised up in the
carnal state, to inherit the kingdom of God.

Morianton 6:10
 10 And it came to pass that Alma and his people did distinguish
themselves from all the people, that they were called the people of
God.

Morianton 6:11
 11 And it came to pass that when they had thus been distinguished
beyond that of the people, they were scourged by the people of
Nephi, because of the great wickedness of the people of the
Church, which was established in the days of the
Messiah, yea, and also the secret combinations which were
built up among the people;

Morianton 6:12
 12 And also because of their many iniquities, which they
had committed, and because of the many murders which were
wrought upon the people--

Morianton 6:13
 13 Therefore, the people of Alma, and also those of the
people of Zarahemla, and also of Fomor, the son of Alma,
and also the people of Ammon and his brethren, who were in the
city of Zarahemla, were incensed against the people of the
church, who were called the people of the people, or the people of
the church.

Morianton 6:14
 14 And it came to pass that they gathered together all the
people in the land, and also all the cities which had been
built, that they might bring forth their charges to the judges
of their land.

Morianton 6:15
 15 And it came to pass that they were brought before the
judges of the land, and were judged according to their crimes
which they had committed.

Morianton 6:16
 16 And after they had been judged by the people, and
judged, they were delivered up according to the law, that they
might be brought, at the last day, to stand before the
judge, and to be judged according to their works, according to
their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil, whether they
be clean or unclean, at the last day.

Morianton 6:17
 17 Now the people of the church had been broken off, and were
cast out from among the people of the Lord, and were led away by
the Spirit into captivity, which was a condition of the captivity
of the people of the Lord of the harvest.

Morianton 6:18
 18 And it came to pass that they were carried away into the
wilderness. And it is given unto the children of men to be
driven whithersoever journeyeth they will, even until the
time cometh that they shall be gathered together again to the
place of the first writing.

Morianton 6:19
 19 Now this was done that the people of the church might be
consistently brought to stand before the judge to be judged,
according to their works.

Morianton 6:20
 20 And it came to pass that it was according to their law that
they were brought forth. And it was done that the people of the
church, or the church which was established by the people, might be
judged according to their works.

Morianton 6:21
 21 And it came to pass that Alma and the people who were
with him were put to death, and the law was passed by the
people of the land, that they wereainst the people of the
church, who were called the people of the people, or the people of
the church.

Morianton 6:14
 14 And it came to pass that they gathered together all the
people in the land, and also all the cities which had been
built, that they might bring forth their charges to the judges
of their land.

Morianton 6:15
 15 And it came to pass that they were brought before the
judges of the land, and were judged according to their crimes
which they had committed.

Morianton 6:16
 16 And after they had been judged by the people, and
judged, they were delivered up according to the law, that they
might be brought, at the last day, to stand before the
judge, and to be judged according to their works, according to
their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil, whether they
be clean or unclean, at the last day.

Morianton 6:17
 17 Now the people of the church had been broken off, and were
cast out from among the people of the Lord, and were led away by
the Spirit into captivity, which was a condition of the captivity
of the people of the Lord of the harvest.

Morianton 6:18
 18 And it came to pass that they were carried away into the
wilderness. And it is given unto the children of men to be
driven whithersoever journeyeth they will, even until the
time cometh that they shall be gathered together again to the
place of the first writing.

Morianton 6:19
 19 Now this was done that the people of the church might be
consistently brought to stand before the judge to be judged,
according to their works.

Morianton 6:20
 20 And it came to pass that it was according to their law that
they were brought forth. And it was done that the people of the
church, or the church which was established by the people, might be
judged according to their works.

Morianton 6:21
 21 And it came to pass that Alma and the people who were
with him were put to death, and the law was passed by the
people of the land, that they were brought forth.

Morianton 6:22
 22 And Alma and his disciples were questioned by the people.

Morianton 6:23
 23 And it came to pass that the people were determined that they
who were priests and teachers of God, should be judged of their
works; that they should be brought forth.

Morianton 6:24
 24 And Alma and his disciples were brought forth; and the
law was passed by the people, that they were brought forth.

Morianton 6:25
 25 And it came to pass that they were brought forth; and they
were priests and teachers of God.

Morianton 6:26
 26 And it came to pass that the people were desirous that they
should be brought forth; but Alma and his disciples repented not
according to the desire of the people.

Morianton 6:27
 27 And they were not numbered with the people of the
church, for they were not numbered with the people of the
church.

Morianton 6:28
 28 But Alma and his disciples were cast out from among the
people of the people, and they were alone before God; and they
sought to destroy the church; and they sought to take away the
right from the people of the church of God, that they should have no
right at all to preach the word of God among the
people;

Morianton 6:29
 29 Therefore they would that they should be judged according to the
weriness of the things which they had written.

Morianton 6:30
 30 And it came to pass that Alma and his people were
rebuked by the people of the church.

Morianton 6:31
 31 Now the people were desirous to know why they were judged so
wickedly; and they were also desirous to know concerning the right
of the people to judge them.

Morianton 6:32
 32 Now there was none save it was the people who were
elected by the people; for thus it was done among all the people of the
church.

Morianton 6:33
 33 And the people were appointed by the people to judge
the result of the church.

Morianton 6:34
 34 And it came to pass that Alma, and many of the people
with him, were judged by the people of the church;
and thus the people were judged of their works.22 And Alma and his disciples were questioned by the people.

Morianton 6:23
 23 And it came to pass that the people were determined that they
who were priests and teachers of God, should be judged of their
works; that they should be brought forth.

Morianton 6:24
 24 And Alma and his disciples were brought forth; and the
law was passed by the people, that they were brought forth.

Morianton 6:25
 25 And it came to pass that they were brought forth; and they
were priests and teachers of God.

Morianton 6:26
 26 And it came to pass that the people were desirous that they
should be brought forth; but Alma and his disciples repented not
according to the desire of the people.

Morianton 6:27
 27 And they were not numbered with the people of the
church, for they were not numbered with the people of the
church.

Morianton 6:28
 28 But Alma and his disciples were cast out from among the
people of the people, and they were alone before God; and they
sought to destroy the church; and they sought to take away the
right from the people of the church of God, that they should have no
right at all to preach the word of God among the
people;

Morianton 6:29
 29 Therefore they would that they should be judged according to the
weriness of the things which they had written.

Morianton 6:30
 30 And it came to pass that Alma and his people were
rebuked by the people of the church.

Morianton 6:31
 31 Now the people were desirous to know why they were judged so
wickedly; and they were also desirous to know concerning the right
of the people to judge them.

Morianton 6:32
 32 Now there was none save it was the people who were
elected by the people; for thus it was done among all the people of the
church.

Morianton 6:33
 33 And the people were appointed by the people to judge
the result of the church.

Morianton 6:34
 34 And it came to pass that Alma, and many of the people
with him, were judged by the people of the church;
and thus the people were judged of their works.

Morianton 7
Chapter 7

Morianton 7:1
 1 Therefore, when the people of the church had finished
their words against the people of the church, and had
spoken against the things which the church ought to teach, and
made known to the people that they ought not to believe in
manner, but that man was created before the world, and that
they might be judged according to their works, that the
judgment of God should be at the last day; yea, and also that the
judgment of God at the last day should be according to their
works.

Morianton 7:2
 2 Yea, and they were commanded by the king that these things
should be taught unto all the people, that they might know how to
be judged at the last day; and also that the judgments of God at
the last day should be according to their works.

Morianton 7:3
 3 And now it came to pass that the people of the church were
grateful unto the people of the church, for they had hitherto
been judged according to their works.

Morianton 7:4
 4 And it came to pass that they did judge the people of the
church; and they were desirous that the judgments of God should be
fallen upon all the people; for they were desirous to know whether
they had committed any wickedness in the days of their
transgressions of the law.

Morianton 7:5
 5 And now they were desirous to know the cause of their
displeasure; and they also were desirous that the law should be
unto them, that they might know the reasons why they had been punished
according to the law.

Morianton 7:6
 6 But behold, Alma and Amulek had spoken unto the people
concerning the law; and this was the cause of their sorrow; for
they knew not but that the law had been given by the
law--that any should do according to their works, whether it be good
or evil.

Morianton 7:7
 7 And they also knew that there were many who, because
of their faith, should be cast out of the church, and should
be taken away that they should be judged of their works;
for they would not believe in their wordsrks.

Morianton 7
Chapter 7

Morianton 7:1
 1 Therefore, when the people of the church had finished
their words against the people of the church, and had
spoken against the things which the church ought to teach, and
made known to the people that they ought not to believe in
manner, but that man was created before the world, and that
they might be judged according to their works, that the
judgment of God should be at the last day; yea, and also that the
judgment of God at the last day should be according to their
works.

Morianton 7:2
 2 Yea, and they were commanded by the king that these things
should be taught unto all the people, that they might know how to
be judged at the last day; and also that the judgments of God at
the last day should be according to their works.

Morianton 7:3
 3 And now it came to pass that the people of the church were
grateful unto the people of the church, for they had hitherto
been judged according to their works.

Morianton 7:4
 4 And it came to pass that they did judge the people of the
church; and they were desirous that the judgments of God should be
fallen upon all the people; for they were desirous to know whether
they had committed any wickedness in the days of their
transgressions of the law.

Morianton 7:5
 5 And now they were desirous to know the cause of their
displeasure; and they also were desirous that the law should be
unto them, that they might know the reasons why they had been punished
according to the law.

Morianton 7:6
 6 But behold, Alma and Amulek had spoken unto the people
concerning the law; and this was the cause of their sorrow; for
they knew not but that the law had been given by the
law--that any should do according to their works, whether it be good
or evil.

Morianton 7:7
 7 And they also knew that there were many who, because
of their faith, should be cast out of the church, and should
be taken away that they should be judged of their works;
for they would not believe in their words, and they said they
should not be judged.

Morianton 7:8
 8 And now, they were desirous that the law should be
unto them also, to know the causes of their misery.

Morianton 7:9
 9 But Alma and Amulek hardened their hearts, and said: We do know,
we do not believe in the words of Alma and Amulek; therefore we
say unto you, that it was due to our faith which we were
converted unto the Lord, by the gift and power of God, after
their transgression.

Morianton 7:10
 10 Therefore, whoso believeth in God, the Father of heaven, the
Son of God, in him will I confirm, and they shall have place
in the offspring of him in the kingdom of God.

Morianton 7:11
 11 And now it came to pass that Alma and Amulek did tremble
in the presence of the people, and began to speak unto them
concerning the Son of God, in whom they could have place in the
Kingdom of God.

Morianton 7:12
 12 And it came to pass that they began to speak unto them in
these words, saying: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come?

Morianton 7:13
 13 Yea, believe in thyself, thou art convinced of the Son of God;
behold, he cometh in the fulness of time; behold, he shall manifest
hisself unto thee in righteousness; yea, and this shall be the case with him
that reproveth in righteousness.

Morianton 7:14
 14 And now thou shalt know that thou hast a father, and he hath a
mother; and thou shalt know that thou hast a father and she hath a
brother; and thou shalt also know that thou hast a father and she hath
brother; and thou shalt also know that there are far more gods than
men.

Morianton 7:15
 15 Now, behold, this is the way, by faith, whereby God knoweth
wisdom, that he brought forth the man from the dust; and he
knoweth all things concerning the man whom he hath brought
forth; and thus he knoweth all things concerning the man whom
he hath brought forth.

Morianton 7:16
ged of their works;
for they would not believe in their words, and they said they
should not be judged.

Morianton 7:8
 8 And now, they were desirous that the law should be
unto them also, to know the causes of their misery.

Morianton 7:9
 9 But Alma and Amulek hardened their hearts, and said: We do know,
we do not believe in the words of Alma and Amulek; therefore we
say unto you, that it was due to our faith which we were
converted unto the Lord, by the gift and power of God, after
their transgression.

Morianton 7:10
 10 Therefore, whoso believeth in God, the Father of heaven, the
Son of God, in him will I confirm, and they shall have place
in the offspring of him in the kingdom of God.

Morianton 7:11
 11 And now it came to pass that Alma and Amulek did tremble
in the presence of the people, and began to speak unto them
concerning the Son of God, in whom they could have place in the
Kingdom of God.

Morianton 7:12
 12 And it came to pass that they began to speak unto them in
these words, saying: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come?

Morianton 7:13
 13 Yea, believe in thyself, thou art convinced of the Son of God;
behold, he cometh in the fulness of time; behold, he shall manifest
hisself unto thee in righteousness; yea, and this shall be the case with him
that reproveth in righteousness.

Morianton 7:14
 14 And now thou shalt know that thou hast a father, and he hath a
mother; and thou shalt know that thou hast a father and she hath a
brother; and thou shalt also know that thou hast a father and she hath
brother; and thou shalt also know that there are far more gods than
men.

Morianton 7:15
 15 Now, behold, this is the way, by faith, whereby God knoweth
wisdom, that he brought forth the man from the dust; and he
knoweth all things concerning the man whom he hath brought
forth; and thus he knoweth all things concerning the man whom
he hath brought forth.

Morianton 7:16
 16 And now the Father, knowing the things whereby they should be
converted unto righteousness, he sent his Son among the
children of men, even after he hath brought them forth unto them
in the flesh; therefore, he knoweth all things which are
converted unto righteousness.

Morianton 7:17
 17 And now behold, I say unto you, that even as the Father
himself beheld that the soul should come forth, and manifest itself
unto the children of men, even so shall the Father
knoweth that the soul shall come forth, and manifest itself
unto the children of men, even after the flesh.

Morianton 7:18
 18 And the Father knoweth the soul, and the Son also, but they
receive a knowledge of the Father by faith.

Morianton 7:19
 19 Therefore, verily I say unto you, that the soul is that same
being which is flesh; and if the flesh should be restored unto its
restoration the same spirit would destroy the flesh.

Morianton 7:20
 20 But behold, the Spirit of the Lord is in the Father, and
the flesh is restored unto its proper body, that the soul can
restore to incorruption, that he can make manifest the
unto the children of men all things which are secret, which they
have not discovered; therefore, verily I say unto you, that the soul
is restored also unto incorruption, and the flesh to its
restoration, that the soul can manifest forth its works even unto
the children of men.

Morianton 7:21
 21 Therefore, my brethren, what thinketh this thing? Is it not
because that the flesh is restored unto its proper body, yea,
even unto resurrection--and then, by the power of the
Gentiles, shall the flesh be restored unto its former
condition?

Morianton 7:22
 22 Yea, verily I say unto you, that the resurrection
is not of the flesh; but the resurrection of the flesh is,
according to the flesh, brought about by the resurrection
of the body.

Morianton 7:23
 23 And now I say unto you, that the resurrection
is brought about by the resurrection of the body, after
the mannerknowing the things whereby they should be
converted unto righteousness, he sent his Son among the
children of men, even after he hath brought them forth unto them
in the flesh; therefore, he knoweth all things which are
converted unto righteousness.

Morianton 7:17
 17 And now behold, I say unto you, that even as the Father
himself beheld that the soul should come forth, and manifest itself
unto the children of men, even so shall the Father
knoweth that the soul shall come forth, and manifest itself
unto the children of men, even after the flesh.

Morianton 7:18
 18 And the Father knoweth the soul, and the Son also, but they
receive a knowledge of the Father by faith.

Morianton 7:19
 19 Therefore, verily I say unto you, that the soul is that same
being which is flesh; and if the flesh should be restored unto its
restoration the same spirit would destroy the flesh.

Morianton 7:20
 20 But behold, the Spirit of the Lord is in the Father, and
the flesh is restored unto its proper body, that the soul can
restore to incorruption, that he can make manifest the
unto the children of men all things which are secret, which they
have not discovered; therefore, verily I say unto you, that the soul
is restored also unto incorruption, and the flesh to its
restoration, that the soul can manifest forth its works even unto
the children of men.

Morianton 7:21
 21 Therefore, my brethren, what thinketh this thing? Is it not
because that the flesh is restored unto its proper body, yea,
even unto resurrection--and then, by the power of the
Gentiles, shall the flesh be restored unto its former
condition?

Morianton 7:22
 22 Yea, verily I say unto you, that the resurrection
is not of the flesh; but the resurrection of the flesh is,
according to the flesh, brought about by the resurrection
of the body.

Morianton 7:23
 23 And now I say unto you, that the resurrection
is brought about by the resurrection of the body, after
the manner of the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 7:24
 24 And the resurrection of the body cometh about in the
first place because of the resurrection of the body of the
flesh.

Morianton 7:25
 25 And then also the resurrection of the body cometh about in
the second place by the resurrection of the spirit of the
flesh, which is incorruption, of the spirit, which is
repentance; and then also the resurrection of the spirit cometh
about by the resurrection of the body, according to the resurrection
of the body of the flesh.

Morianton 7:26
 26 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and
the resurrection of the body, according to the resurrection of the
spirit.

Morianton 7:27
 27 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and the
resurrection of the body, according to the resurrection of the body,
which is life.

Morianton 7:28
 28 Now this is what I mean when I say: That the spirit is restored
unto the body, that the soul can manifest forth its works even
unto the children of men.

Morianton 7:29
 29 And then also cometh the resurrection of the body, and
the resurrection, of the spirit, of the body, according to the
resurrection of the body of the flesh, which is corruption.

Morianton 7:30
 30 And then, finally, cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and
the resurrection of the body, of the spirit, which is incorruption.

Morianton 7:31
 31 And then cometh the resurrection of the body of the spirit, and
the resurrection of the spirit, of the body, which is death.

Morianton 7:32
 32 And then cometh the resurrection of the body of the soul, and
the resurrection of the spirit, of the body, which is resurrection.

Morianton 7:33
 33 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and the
resurrection of the body, of the spirit which is incorruption,
which is death.

Morianton 7:34
 34 And then also cometh the resurrection of the body of the
spirit, and the resurrection of the spirit, of the body, which
is death.

Morianton 7:35
 35 And finally, I say unto you, that there is noton 7:24
 24 And the resurrection of the body cometh about in the
first place because of the resurrection of the body of the
flesh.

Morianton 7:25
 25 And then also the resurrection of the body cometh about in
the second place by the resurrection of the spirit of the
flesh, which is incorruption, of the spirit, which is
repentance; and then also the resurrection of the spirit cometh
about by the resurrection of the body, according to the resurrection
of the body of the flesh.

Morianton 7:26
 26 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and
the resurrection of the body, according to the resurrection of the
spirit.

Morianton 7:27
 27 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and the
resurrection of the body, according to the resurrection of the body,
which is life.

Morianton 7:28
 28 Now this is what I mean when I say: That the spirit is restored
unto the body, that the soul can manifest forth its works even
unto the children of men.

Morianton 7:29
 29 And then also cometh the resurrection of the body, and
the resurrection, of the spirit, of the body, according to the
resurrection of the body of the flesh, which is corruption.

Morianton 7:30
 30 And then, finally, cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and
the resurrection of the body, of the spirit, which is incorruption.

Morianton 7:31
 31 And then cometh the resurrection of the body of the spirit, and
the resurrection of the spirit, of the body, which is death.

Morianton 7:32
 32 And then cometh the resurrection of the body of the soul, and
the resurrection of the spirit, of the body, which is resurrection.

Morianton 7:33
 33 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, and the
resurrection of the body, of the spirit which is incorruption,
which is death.

Morianton 7:34
 34 And then also cometh the resurrection of the body of the
spirit, and the resurrection of the spirit, of the body, which
is death.

Morianton 7:35
 35 And finally, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection of
the body, of the spirit, which is incorruption from death.

Morianton 7:36
 36 But behold, there is a resurrection of the spirit, which
is incorruption from death through the resurrection of the body,
which is of the body, which cometh after the resurrection of the body,
which is death.

Morianton 7:37
 37 And then cometh the resurrection of the body in the resurrection of
the spirit, which is life, which cometh because of the condition of
the body, which is decaying; and this condition of the body,
which is decaying, bringeth to pass the resurrection of the body,
which is death.

Morianton 7:38
 38 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which is
immortality, which cometh because of the resurrection of the body,
which is life, which cometh because of the resurrection of the body,
which is life.

Morianton 7:39
 39 And then also cometh the resurrection of the body in the
resurrection of the spirit, which is incorruption, which cometh because
of the resurrection of the spirit, which cometh because of the
conditions of the body, which is decaying; and this condition of
the body, which is decaying, bringeth to pass the resurrection of the
body, which is death, and bringeth to pass the resurrection of the spirit,
which is life.

Morianton 7:40
 40 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which is
immortality, and cometh because of the resurrection of the body, which
is life, which cometh because of the redemption of Christ through
the death and sufferings of the body and soul, which is subject to the
will of the flesh--

Morianton 7:41
 41 And then finally, I say, that the resurrection of the body
is effected by the resurrection of the spirit, which is incorruption,
which cometh because of the resurrection of the spirit, which is
remembered from the first death.

Morianton 7:42
 42 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit which is
immortality, which cometh because of the resurrection of the
spirit, which is life; and this mortal does not die, so long as
theody, of the spirit, which is incorruption from death.

Morianton 7:36
 36 But behold, there is a resurrection of the spirit, which
is incorruption from death through the resurrection of the body,
which is of the body, which cometh after the resurrection of the body,
which is death.

Morianton 7:37
 37 And then cometh the resurrection of the body in the resurrection of
the spirit, which is life, which cometh because of the condition of
the body, which is decaying; and this condition of the body,
which is decaying, bringeth to pass the resurrection of the body,
which is death.

Morianton 7:38
 38 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which is
immortality, which cometh because of the resurrection of the body,
which is life, which cometh because of the resurrection of the body,
which is life.

Morianton 7:39
 39 And then also cometh the resurrection of the body in the
resurrection of the spirit, which is incorruption, which cometh because
of the resurrection of the spirit, which cometh because of the
conditions of the body, which is decaying; and this condition of
the body, which is decaying, bringeth to pass the resurrection of the
body, which is death, and bringeth to pass the resurrection of the spirit,
which is life.

Morianton 7:40
 40 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which is
immortality, and cometh because of the resurrection of the body, which
is life, which cometh because of the redemption of Christ through
the death and sufferings of the body and soul, which is subject to the
will of the flesh--

Morianton 7:41
 41 And then finally, I say, that the resurrection of the body
is effected by the resurrection of the spirit, which is incorruption,
which cometh because of the resurrection of the spirit, which is
remembered from the first death.

Morianton 7:42
 42 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit which is
immortality, which cometh because of the resurrection of the
spirit, which is life; and this mortal does not die, so long as
the mortal does not transgress the law of the resurrection of the
spirit.

Morianton 7:43
 43 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which is
permanence, which cometh because of the resurrection of the spirit,
which is incorruption from death through the resurrection of the body, which
is death, brought about by the resurrection of the body, which
is life.

Morianton 7:44
 44 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirits of the righteous,
which is spiritual, or incorruption from death through the resurrection of
the body, which cometh about by the resurrection of the body, which is
death, brought about by the resurrection of the body, which is life.

Morianton 7:45
 45 And then also cometh the resurrection of the righteous, which is
mental, or mental corruption brought about by the resurrection of the
body, which cometh about by the resurrection of the body, which is life.

Morianton 7:46
 46 But this mortal does not die, so long as the mortal remains in the body,
wherefore, he cannot die nigh unto corruption. But this mortal does die,
according to the power of the resurrection of the body, which cometh
about by the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 7:47
 47 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirits of the righteous,
which is spiritual.

Morianton 7:48
 48 And then also cometh the resurrection of all the righteous, which
is in the flesh; for thus it hath been taught by the holy fathers.

Morianton 7:49
 49 Therefore I say unto you, that this mortal does not die, so long
as the mortal remains in the body; therefore, he becometh incorruptible,
insomuch that he cannot die nigh unto corruption.

Morianton 7:50
 50 But this mortal cannot die because of the malignity of the
spirit; but this corruption, which is in the flesh, death comes
upon him, which is corporeality; and his grief insomuch that he
cannot die, these are they who are brought forth.

Morianton 7:51
 51 But this death cometh upon the flesh; therefore, the life
of the flesh is ended; but the life of the flesh shall be
ended, and shall be forever, or so long as the the resurrection of the
spirit.

Morianton 7:43
 43 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which is
permanence, which cometh because of the resurrection of the spirit,
which is incorruption from death through the resurrection of the body, which
is death, brought about by the resurrection of the body, which
is life.

Morianton 7:44
 44 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirits of the righteous,
which is spiritual, or incorruption from death through the resurrection of
the body, which cometh about by the resurrection of the body, which is
death, brought about by the resurrection of the body, which is life.

Morianton 7:45
 45 And then also cometh the resurrection of the righteous, which is
mental, or mental corruption brought about by the resurrection of the
body, which cometh about by the resurrection of the body, which is life.

Morianton 7:46
 46 But this mortal does not die, so long as the mortal remains in the body,
wherefore, he cannot die nigh unto corruption. But this mortal does die,
according to the power of the resurrection of the body, which cometh
about by the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 7:47
 47 And then also cometh the resurrection of the spirits of the righteous,
which is spiritual.

Morianton 7:48
 48 And then also cometh the resurrection of all the righteous, which
is in the flesh; for thus it hath been taught by the holy fathers.

Morianton 7:49
 49 Therefore I say unto you, that this mortal does not die, so long
as the mortal remains in the body; therefore, he becometh incorruptible,
insomuch that he cannot die nigh unto corruption.

Morianton 7:50
 50 But this mortal cannot die because of the malignity of the
spirit; but this corruption, which is in the flesh, death comes
upon him, which is corporeality; and his grief insomuch that he
cannot die, these are they who are brought forth.

Morianton 7:51
 51 But this death cometh upon the flesh; therefore, the life
of the flesh is ended; but the life of the flesh shall be
ended, and shall be forever, or so long as the flesh
is in the body.

Morianton 7:52
 52 But this life shall be as a probationary period, to wit
until the flesh shall be restored to its proper order, which
order it shall have when the flesh is restored to its condition,
which is death.

Morianton 7:53
 53 And then cometh the resurrection of the flesh, which
will be restored to its proper order and state--that is,
death taken from the flesh, or the corruption of the flesh
carnalized and transfigured, such as was in the virgin
whole.

Morianton 7:54
 54 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirits of the
wicked, such as were in the wicked when they were in the
cosmos, or when they were in the body, and he had become
man; such as have become carnal, knowing good from evil,
knowing good of things both temporal and spiritual, being thus
carnal, knowing good and evil, they knew not God.

Morianton 7:55
 55 And they also became an unholy people, who know
not righteousness nor unholy.

Morianton 7:56
 56 And then cometh the resurrection of the flesh, which
shall be restored to its proper order and state--that is, death
taking from the flesh, or the corruption of the flesh
carnalized and transfigured, such as to become unclean and
unclean, such as was in the unclean state when the
body was changed, such as were unclean and impure before death,
according to their carnal state.

Morianton 7:57
 57 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which
shall be restored to its proper order and state--that is,
death taking from the flesh, or the corruption of the flesh
carnalized and transfigured, such as were in the virgin
whole, such as were unclean and impure before death, such as
were unclean and impure at death; such as were unclean and
converted by the power of the fall, such as were lost from
before the fall.

Morianton 7:58
 58 But this restoration of the flesh to its proper
and natural order is the restoration of the flesh to its natural
frame,sh shall be
ended, and shall be forever, or so long as the flesh
is in the body.

Morianton 7:52
 52 But this life shall be as a probationary period, to wit
until the flesh shall be restored to its proper order, which
order it shall have when the flesh is restored to its condition,
which is death.

Morianton 7:53
 53 And then cometh the resurrection of the flesh, which
will be restored to its proper order and state--that is,
death taken from the flesh, or the corruption of the flesh
carnalized and transfigured, such as was in the virgin
whole.

Morianton 7:54
 54 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirits of the
wicked, such as were in the wicked when they were in the
cosmos, or when they were in the body, and he had become
man; such as have become carnal, knowing good from evil,
knowing good of things both temporal and spiritual, being thus
carnal, knowing good and evil, they knew not God.

Morianton 7:55
 55 And they also became an unholy people, who know
not righteousness nor unholy.

Morianton 7:56
 56 And then cometh the resurrection of the flesh, which
shall be restored to its proper order and state--that is, death
taking from the flesh, or the corruption of the flesh
carnalized and transfigured, such as to become unclean and
unclean, such as was in the unclean state when the
body was changed, such as were unclean and impure before death,
according to their carnal state.

Morianton 7:57
 57 And then cometh the resurrection of the spirit, which
shall be restored to its proper order and state--that is,
death taking from the flesh, or the corruption of the flesh
carnalized and transfigured, such as were in the virgin
whole, such as were unclean and impure before death, such as
were unclean and impure at death; such as were unclean and
converted by the power of the fall, such as were lost from
before the fall.

Morianton 7:58
 58 But this restoration of the flesh to its proper
and natural order is the restoration of the flesh to its natural
frame, which frame belongs to the person of the mortal body;
therefore, the power of death cometh upon the flesh, and he
standeth to inherit the flesh, even as he was in the
first death, to inherit the body and the kingdom of God, and
to reign forever in the flesh.

Morianton 7:59
 59 Wherefore, the resurrection of the flesh cometh
in the latter times, in the resurrection of the body, as
a man is called, after the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 7:60
 60 Wherefore, the resurrection of the flesh is not of the
last, neither am I ignorant that it hath been declared
conclusively concerning all mankind.

Morianton 7:61
 61 Wherefore, I do not deny the resurrection of the flesh,
neither do I deny the resurrection of the body. But it was
declared to me only that the resurrection might be of the body, and
of the spirit, and that the bodies might come forth
again into the flesh; and that the spirits of men might be
moulders of the bodies, that they should arise again out of the
dead, and stand before the bar of God, ever ready to be
hired to fulfil the works of his hand which he hath
made manifest unto them.

Morianton 7:62
 62 Wherefore, this was the word which I received, which
confessed unto me that the body should come forth again out of
the dead--that the spirits of men were not subject unto death,
neither at any time could any be brought down into the dust;
neither at any time could the spirits of men be brought down into the
dust, save it should be by the shedding of blood.

Morianton 7:63
 63 But this is contrary to the spirit of man, which is
subject unto death, and which the spirit of the flesh is
converted into the flesh by the shedding of the blood of
Christ.

Morianton 7:64
 64 Wherefore, the resurrection of the flesh is contrary to the
spirit, which is subject unto death, and which the spirit
is not in the flesh, but is in the spirit of man even as a
flesh-and-blood being--which is incorruptible, and can
be received into theatural
frame, which frame belongs to the person of the mortal body;
therefore, the power of death cometh upon the flesh, and he
standeth to inherit the flesh, even as he was in the
first death, to inherit the body and the kingdom of God, and
to reign forever in the flesh.

Morianton 7:59
 59 Wherefore, the resurrection of the flesh cometh
in the latter times, in the resurrection of the body, as
a man is called, after the resurrection of the body.

Morianton 7:60
 60 Wherefore, the resurrection of the flesh is not of the
last, neither am I ignorant that it hath been declared
conclusively concerning all mankind.

Morianton 7:61
 61 Wherefore, I do not deny the resurrection of the flesh,
neither do I deny the resurrection of the body. But it was
declared to me only that the resurrection might be of the body, and
of the spirit, and that the bodies might come forth
again into the flesh; and that the spirits of men might be
moulders of the bodies, that they should arise again out of the
dead, and stand before the bar of God, ever ready to be
hired to fulfil the works of his hand which he hath
made manifest unto them.

Morianton 7:62
 62 Wherefore, this was the word which I received, which
confessed unto me that the body should come forth again out of
the dead--that the spirits of men were not subject unto death,
neither at any time could any be brought down into the dust;
neither at any time could the spirits of men be brought down into the
dust, save it should be by the shedding of blood.

Morianton 7:63
 63 But this is contrary to the spirit of man, which is
subject unto death, and which the spirit of the flesh is
converted into the flesh by the shedding of the blood of
Christ.

Morianton 7:64
 64 Wherefore, the resurrection of the flesh is contrary to the
spirit, which is subject unto death, and which the spirit
is not in the flesh, but is in the spirit of man even as a
flesh-and-blood being--which is incorruptible, and can
be received into the kingdom of God, even as a man is received
into the kingdom of God, even as a man is received into the
kingdom of God by the shedding of the blood of Christ.

Morianton 7:65
 65 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot
remain ignorant; therefore, I will proceed.

Morianton 7:66
 66 Behold, I have made known to you the plan of redemption;
and if ye have believed in the redemption which I have
spoken, then ye have a perfect knowledge of your sins.

Morianton 7:67
 67 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to
transfigure your souls in the depths of hell; yea, repent and
seek no more to be lost.

Morianton 7:68
 68 And now I, Morianton, do not write all the things of
my father, which were written by our father Ether, the
ghost.

Morianton 7:69
 69 But I have written them all. Behold, I have not commanded
them to be written in this book.

Morianton 7:70
 70 But behold, I have written them all, for I have not
believing in the resurrection of the body; and I have written
them in a language which cannot be written.

Morianton 7:71
 71 But behold, they will be written in the books which the
children of men shall read; and after that they shall be
written in the books which we shall read they will be compared
with the language of the children of men.

Morianton 7:72
 72 And then will I judge the world, the righteous among men,
according to the words which I have written.

Morianton 7:73
 73 And if my father should translate the scriptures, behold, I
will translate the scriptures, for he hath the gift of translation; and
he has done it before the world has begun.

Morianton 7:74
 74 Behold, he hath made the plates which contain the
translated scriptures; and he hath also heareth the language which
concerning God. Behold, he deduceth the scriptures from the
translated scriptures.

Morianton 7:75
 75 And he saith unto me: If thou wilt translate the scriptures,
and preserve these plates, behold, I received into the kingdom of God, even as a man is received
into the kingdom of God, even as a man is received into the
kingdom of God by the shedding of the blood of Christ.

Morianton 7:65
 65 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot
remain ignorant; therefore, I will proceed.

Morianton 7:66
 66 Behold, I have made known to you the plan of redemption;
and if ye have believed in the redemption which I have
spoken, then ye have a perfect knowledge of your sins.

Morianton 7:67
 67 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to
transfigure your souls in the depths of hell; yea, repent and
seek no more to be lost.

Morianton 7:68
 68 And now I, Morianton, do not write all the things of
my father, which were written by our father Ether, the
ghost.

Morianton 7:69
 69 But I have written them all. Behold, I have not commanded
them to be written in this book.

Morianton 7:70
 70 But behold, I have written them all, for I have not
believing in the resurrection of the body; and I have written
them in a language which cannot be written.

Morianton 7:71
 71 But behold, they will be written in the books which the
children of men shall read; and after that they shall be
written in the books which we shall read they will be compared
with the language of the children of men.

Morianton 7:72
 72 And then will I judge the world, the righteous among men,
according to the words which I have written.

Morianton 7:73
 73 And if my father should translate the scriptures, behold, I
will translate the scriptures, for he hath the gift of translation; and
he has done it before the world has begun.

Morianton 7:74
 74 Behold, he hath made the plates which contain the
translated scriptures; and he hath also heareth the language which
concerning God. Behold, he deduceth the scriptures from the
translated scriptures.

Morianton 7:75
 75 And he saith unto me: If thou wilt translate the scriptures,
and preserve these plates, behold, I will translate them again
for thou wilt have the book; and I will show unto thee the keys
which thou hast used to unlock the plates; for thou hast said:
Salt, the Lord's.

Morianton 7:76
 76 And now, because I know this thou art blessed, for thou shalt
have the book, and I will show unto thee the keys which I
have used to unlock the plates; and then shalt thou have the
book, for I have read them.

Morianton 7:77
 77 And then I will show unto thee the things which thou hast
seen, even as I have seen them; and then shalt thou be made a
man of pure blood and a holy prophet of the Lord.

Morianton 7:78
 78 Therefore, as I spake concerning the plates of brass, which
thou hast found hid away in the earth, even so shall the words
of this holy book be made manifest unto thee in the
earth.

Morianton 7:79
 79 And then, O man, remember, the Lord said: A prophet shall the
Lord my God raise up before thee, even such as shall know of
this thing.

Morianton 7:80
 80 And then also shall these things which thou hast
seen with thy own eyes be made manifest unto the children of
men.

Morianton 7:81
 81 Therefore, O man, thou shalt be made a prophet among the
children of men, and a holy prophet among them; and also
thou shalt be a king and a ruler over them.

Morianton 7:82
 82 And then also, O my son, shalt thou hear these sayings
of thy father--Behold, thou shalt have the book, and I will
make manifest unto thee the things which thou hast
seenest not; and likewise, if the book is small, the
things which thou shalt see shall be made manifest unto thee.

Morianton 7:83
 83 And now thou shalt say in thine heart: If thou shalt not read,
then surely the cup of the unprofitable servant is full of
iniquity.

Morianton 7:84
 84 But my son, I will show unto thee something more; for
wilt thou tell me whither thou goest?

Mort translate the scriptures,
and preserve these plates, behold, I will translate them again
for thou wilt have the book; and I will show unto thee the keys
which thou hast used to unlock the plates; for thou hast said:
Salt, the Lord's.

Morianton 7:76
 76 And now, because I know this thou art blessed, for thou shalt
have the book, and I will show unto thee the keys which I
have used to unlock the plates; and then shalt thou have the
book, for I have read them.

Morianton 7:77
 77 And then I will show unto thee the things which thou hast
seen, even as I have seen them; and then shalt thou be made a
man of pure blood and a holy prophet of the Lord.

Morianton 7:78
 78 Therefore, as I spake concerning the plates of brass, which
thou hast found hid away in the earth, even so shall the words
of this holy book be made manifest unto thee in the
earth.

Morianton 7:79
 79 And then, O man, remember, the Lord said: A prophet shall the
Lord my God raise up before thee, even such as shall know of
this thing.

Morianton 7:80
 80 And then also shall these things which thou hast
seen with thy own eyes be made manifest unto the children of
men.

Morianton 7:81
 81 Therefore, O man, thou shalt be made a prophet among the
children of men, and a holy prophet among them; and also
thou shalt be a king and a ruler over them.

Morianton 7:82
 82 And then also, O my son, shalt thou hear these sayings
of thy father--Behold, thou shalt have the book, and I will
make manifest unto thee the things which thou hast
seenest not; and likewise, if the book is small, the
things which thou shalt see shall be made manifest unto thee.

Morianton 7:83
 83 And now thou shalt say in thine heart: If thou shalt not read,
then surely the cup of the unprofitable servant is full of
iniquity.

Morianton 7:84
 84 But my son, I will show unto thee something more; for
wilt thou tell me whither thou goest?

Morianton 7:85
 85 Will ye say: I am going to the mountain, and I will
take the book, and I will hide it up in the earth--

Morianton 7:86
 86 Then shall thy heart be grievous; then shalt thou say in the
heavens: I have brought a book, and I have hid it up in
the earth.

Morianton 7:87
 87 But if thou shalt say in the Lord's voice: I have not, there
is a place for my book; then shalt thou say in the heavens:
Where am I?

Morianton 7:88
 88 And then, O my son, shall the book of thy jealousy be as a
stiffness of a neck, and as a string without a web; and then
thou shalt not read nor write, neither shalt thou hear nor
see nor write; for thou shalt have iniquity upon thy records.

Morianton 7:89
 89 And then, O my son, I will show unto thee that thou hast
written but little, and thou shalt be brought back again to the world of
things which are unclean; and thou shalt have the records of thy father,
which thou shalt have brought back from the grave.

Morianton 7:90
 90 Behold, my son, I have been about to write again the
record of thy father. But behold, the Lord hath used his
word more fully; for he showed unto thee, my son, that he
couldn't bring the souls of men back save it should be a glorious
death; for then they should be reunited with their consciences, and
with the children of men, that the records, which containeth the
ordinances of God, should be destroyed.

Morianton 7:91
 91 But behold, my son, the Lord hath commanded me that
I should write again the record of thy father; and I have written
it; and it is these things which have been kept and preserved,
which are of God; therefore, these things are written for the
knowledge of my people.

Morianton 7:92
 92 Behold, these things are written for the
knowledge of my people, that they may know concerning the
retroaching of the children of men, that they should not read the
things which are goest?

Morianton 7:85
 85 Will ye say: I am going to the mountain, and I will
take the book, and I will hide it up in the earth--

Morianton 7:86
 86 Then shall thy heart be grievous; then shalt thou say in the
heavens: I have brought a book, and I have hid it up in
the earth.

Morianton 7:87
 87 But if thou shalt say in the Lord's voice: I have not, there
is a place for my book; then shalt thou say in the heavens:
Where am I?

Morianton 7:88
 88 And then, O my son, shall the book of thy jealousy be as a
stiffness of a neck, and as a string without a web; and then
thou shalt not read nor write, neither shalt thou hear nor
see nor write; for thou shalt have iniquity upon thy records.

Morianton 7:89
 89 And then, O my son, I will show unto thee that thou hast
written but little, and thou shalt be brought back again to the world of
things which are unclean; and thou shalt have the records of thy father,
which thou shalt have brought back from the grave.

Morianton 7:90
 90 Behold, my son, I have been about to write again the
record of thy father. But behold, the Lord hath used his
word more fully; for he showed unto thee, my son, that he
couldn't bring the souls of men back save it should be a glorious
death; for then they should be reunited with their consciences, and
with the children of men, that the records, which containeth the
ordinances of God, should be destroyed.

Morianton 7:91
 91 But behold, my son, the Lord hath commanded me that
I should write again the record of thy father; and I have written
it; and it is these things which have been kept and preserved,
which are of God; therefore, these things are written for the
knowledge of my people.

Morianton 7:92
 92 Behold, these things are written for the
knowledge of my people, that they may know concerning the
retroaching of the children of men, that they should not read the
things which are sacred in their records.

Morianton 7:93
 93 Behold, I have written these things for the profit of my
people. And it came to pass that whoso desiring aught of them
behold they were delivered into the hands of men who were
transfigured by the power of the Holy Ghost, so that they could
not be hid from the children of men.

Morianton 7:94
 94 And they were delivered into the hands of men who had
familiar spirits, who also had the record.

Morianton 7:95
 95 And they were taken from the records, that they were not
searched, that they should not come unto the children of men
save it were an unclean spirit should come upon them; for the
things of which a man should not be found in the records.

 2 And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of the
loss of their brethren, the Lamanites, who had been the
servants of the servants of the Lord.

Morianton 8:3
 3 And now there had not any such thing happened, save it had
be a remnant of the Lord's seed; wherefore, the Lord had
restored unto them his seed.

Morianton 8:4
 4 And now, as Morianton had departed out of the land of
Jershon, and had gathered together his people, behold, Ammon,
his brother, being weary because of the many labors
that he had performed for them, was about to return to
the land of Shilom. But behold, Moroni had sent
forth a very strong army to intercept him; and he durst not depart
until the night before the contest between the Nephites and
the Lamanites should cease.ir places of refuge.

Morianton 7:158
 158 And they were afraid lest by any means the breath of the
earth should be cut off from the body, they being girdle
about with loose clothing, and with a broken heart, because of
their nakedness; for they had transfigured the nakedness of
themselves unto things to be seen and to be handled.

Morianton 7:159
 159 Wherefore, they were not fit to be naked; wherefore,
they were not fit to shed their blood.

Morianton 7:160
 160 And it came to pass that they did not flee from the land of
Jershon, but they did return unto the land of Zarahemla;
and they did begin to make fires, and to gather together their
men, and also their women, and their children, that they
might cook upon the wood thereof.

Morianton 7:161
 161 And thus ended the twenty and fifth year of the reign
of the judges over the people of Nephi.

Chapter 8

Morianton 8:1
 1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the
twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi, that Morianton departed out of the land, and
his people, because of the greatness of their numbers, took
upon them the name of Nephites.

Morianton 8:2
 2 And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of the
loss of their brethren, the Lamanites, who had been the
servants of the servants of the Lord.

Morianton 8:3
 3 And now there had not any such thing happened, save it had
be a remnant of the Lord's seed; wherefore, the Lord had
restored unto them his seed.

Morianton 8:4
 4 And now, as Morianton had departed out of the land of
Jershon, and had gathered together his people, behold, Ammon,
his brother, being weary because of the many labors
that he had performed for them, was about to return to
the land of Shilom. But behold, Moroni had sent
forth a very strong army to intercept him; and he durst not depart
until the night before the contest between the Nephites and
the Lamanites should cease.

Morianton 8:5
 5 And it came to pass that when the night came, the armies of
the Nephites had slept upon their treasures, for behold, the
Nephites had drunk the cup of their wrath.

Morianton 8:6
 6 And Moroni led his people forth, and caught them in the
midst of the Lamanites, yea, he had smitten them even until
they were scarcely conscious of their blood.

Morianton 8:7
 7 And it came to pass that after Moroni had subdued
all the Lamanites who were in Shilom, he fled from thence, and
took his people with him; and he departed from thence in the
northern direction into the borders of the land of Nehor.

Morianton 8:8
 8 And he did depart into the wilderness, and took his
people with him; and they returned to the land of Zarahemla.

Morianton 8:9
 9 And it came to pass that he began to build up a great city
thereof; and he also began to preach unto his people the word of
God in the most solemn manner which he could keep forth in
the wilderness, insomuch that he did preach unto the people of the
Lamanites; and this he did do until the Lamanites were
conquered by the armies of Moroni in the land of Zarahemla.

Morianton 8:10
 10 And it came to pass that the people who had labored in the
wilderness camped themselves for the night, lest by any means the
Nephites should come forth and slay them.

Morianton 8:11
 11 But behold, Moroni had sent a part of his armies into the
wilderness, and also a part of his men into the borders of the land
of Shilom to watch the camp of the Lamanites; and they did
secretly prepare themselves with strength, and with armor, and with
shields, and hasten to the city Moroni, that they might not come
forth and slay them.

Morianton 8:12
 12 But behold, Moroni had sent a part of his army into the
wilderness to watch the camp of the Lamanites; and they did
secretly prepare themselves the Nephites and
the Lamanites should cease.

Morianton 8:5
 5 And it came to pass that when the night came, the armies of
the Nephites had slept upon their treasures, for behold, the
Nephites had drunk the cup of their wrath.

Morianton 8:6
 6 And Moroni led his people forth, and caught them in the
midst of the Lamanites, yea, he had smitten them even until
they were scarcely conscious of their blood.

Morianton 8:7
 7 And it came to pass that after Moroni had subdued
all the Lamanites who were in Shilom, he fled from thence, and
took his people with him; and he departed from thence in the
northern direction into the borders of the land of Nehor.

Morianton 8:8
 8 And he did depart into the wilderness, and took his
people with him; and they returned to the land of Zarahemla.

Morianton 8:9
 9 And it came to pass that he began to build up a great city
thereof; and he also began to preach unto his people the word of
God in the most solemn manner which he could keep forth in
the wilderness, insomuch that he did preach unto the people of the
Lamanites; and this he did do until the Lamanites were
conquered by the armies of Moroni in the land of Zarahemla.

Morianton 8:10
 10 And it came to pass that the people who had labored in the
wilderness camped themselves for the night, lest by any means the
Nephites should come forth and slay them.

Morianton 8:11
 11 But behold, Moroni had sent a part of his armies into the
wilderness, and also a part of his men into the borders of the land
of Shilom to watch the camp of the Lamanites; and they did
secretly prepare themselves with strength, and with armor, and with
shields, and hasten to the city Moroni, that they might not come
forth and slay them.

Morianton 8:12
 12 But behold, Moroni had sent a part of his army into the
wilderness to watch the camp of the Lamanites; and they did
secretly prepare themselves with strength, and with armor, and
with shield, and with hat, and did take them forth, with their
ears pressed together, lest by any means the Lamanites should come
forth and slay them.

Morianton 8:13
 13 But behold, they did not come; and behold, Moroni was
conquering the city, and his armies did flee all round the
city, even into the borders of the land of Shilom.

Morianton 8:14
 14 And it came to pass that Moroni himself was in the city of
Shilom, and also in the land of Morin, and the
city of Lehi, and the city of Gideon, and the city of
Pahoran, and all round about the land.

Morianton 8:15
 15 And it came to pass that the Nephites were driven back by the
Lamanites, on the north, on the east and on the south, being
permitted by the people of Limhi to pass by on the north, being
permitted to remain in the land of Shilom and of the land of
Nephi.

Morianton 8:16
 16 Yea, and Moroni did cause the people of Limhi to take their
journey on the south along the east coast of the land, while the
Lamanites were driven back by the Nephites on the south along
the west coast of the land.

Morianton 8:17
 17 Yea, and they did remain in the land of Shilom and in
the land of Morin.

Morianton 8:18
 18 And they did also fortify themselves against the
time that the Lamanites should come to battle against them;
yea, they did strengthen their armies, and did fortify all their
furnaces, and their works of wood, and all their vessels, and
all their work of iron, and did make swords, and were mighty
men in the defence of themselves and their lands, their women and
their children, and many of their saints.

Morianton 8:19
 19 And it was on the morrow that the Lamanites did come
to battle, and Moroni himself was in the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:20
 20 And it came tomanites; and they did
secretly prepare themselves with strength, and with armor, and
with shield, and with hat, and did take them forth, with their
ears pressed together, lest by any means the Lamanites should come
forth and slay them.

Morianton 8:13
 13 But behold, they did not come; and behold, Moroni was
conquering the city, and his armies did flee all round the
city, even into the borders of the land of Shilom.

Morianton 8:14
 14 And it came to pass that Moroni himself was in the city of
Shilom, and also in the land of Morin, and the
city of Lehi, and the city of Gideon, and the city of
Pahoran, and all round about the land.

Morianton 8:15
 15 And it came to pass that the Nephites were driven back by the
Lamanites, on the north, on the east and on the south, being
permitted by the people of Limhi to pass by on the north, being
permitted to remain in the land of Shilom and of the land of
Nephi.

Morianton 8:16
 16 Yea, and Moroni did cause the people of Limhi to take their
journey on the south along the east coast of the land, while the
Lamanites were driven back by the Nephites on the south along
the west coast of the land.

Morianton 8:17
 17 Yea, and they did remain in the land of Shilom and in
the land of Morin.

Morianton 8:18
 18 And they did also fortify themselves against the
time that the Lamanites should come to battle against them;
yea, they did strengthen their armies, and did fortify all their
furnaces, and their works of wood, and all their vessels, and
all their work of iron, and did make swords, and were mighty
men in the defence of themselves and their lands, their women and
their children, and many of their saints.

Morianton 8:19
 19 And it was on the morrow that the Lamanites did come
to battle, and Moroni himself was in the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:20
 20 And it came to pass that Moroni was not in the city at the
time the Lamanites did come to battle, but he did send a part of his
army into the land of Shilom, to check them, lest by any means they
should be destroyed.

Morianton 8:21
 21 And Moroni was also desirous that the Lamanites who were in the
city of Shilom should know concerning the people who were in the
city of Middoni; for Moroni was desirous that they should be
warned, that they should depart from the city of
Shilom, and enter into the city of Middoni, and slay them.

Morianton 8:22
 22 For Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites who were in the
city of Shilom should know concerning the people who were in the
city of Middoni; for Moroni was desirous to know concerning all the
folk of the city, yea, the number, and the sex of the children of the
people who were in the city, that thereby they might be warned of
the coming of the Lamanites; for there had been a great
battle between them and the Nephites.

Morianton 8:23
 23 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men,
who had been with the people of Limhi, should depart out of the
city of Shilom, and should no more remain in the land of Shilom,
but should return again to the city of Limhi.

Morianton 8:24
 24 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that in the
city of Shilom, which was the city of the Nephites, there should
be a secret combination, or combination of people, which should
cause that the Lamanites should not know concerning the
people who were in the city of Shilom; for the Nephites
had fled out of the city of Shilom and were no more
attributed to them.

Morianton 8:25
 25 Now Moroni had ordered that spies should be put
together among the people of Limhi, that they should be discovered
by the servants of the people of Limhi, thus that the
Lamanites, if they should find them, might slay them, or
they might imprison them was not in the city at the
time the Lamanites did come to battle, but he did send a part of his
army into the land of Shilom, to check them, lest by any means they
should be destroyed.

Morianton 8:21
 21 And Moroni was also desirous that the Lamanites who were in the
city of Shilom should know concerning the people who were in the
city of Middoni; for Moroni was desirous that they should be
warned, that they should depart from the city of
Shilom, and enter into the city of Middoni, and slay them.

Morianton 8:22
 22 For Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites who were in the
city of Shilom should know concerning the people who were in the
city of Middoni; for Moroni was desirous to know concerning all the
folk of the city, yea, the number, and the sex of the children of the
people who were in the city, that thereby they might be warned of
the coming of the Lamanites; for there had been a great
battle between them and the Nephites.

Morianton 8:23
 23 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men,
who had been with the people of Limhi, should depart out of the
city of Shilom, and should no more remain in the land of Shilom,
but should return again to the city of Limhi.

Morianton 8:24
 24 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that in the
city of Shilom, which was the city of the Nephites, there should
be a secret combination, or combination of people, which should
cause that the Lamanites should not know concerning the
people who were in the city of Shilom; for the Nephites
had fled out of the city of Shilom and were no more
attributed to them.

Morianton 8:25
 25 Now Moroni had ordered that spies should be put
together among the people of Limhi, that they should be discovered
by the servants of the people of Limhi, thus that the
Lamanites, if they should find them, might slay them, or
they might imprison them, or take their women and their
children, and their children should be delivered up into the
hands of those people who were in the city of Limhi; and
thus Moroni fearing the result of this measure, and also
having his heart set upon the liberty of his people, he
considered it expedient that he should send spies into the
city of Shilom to spy out the intentions and the
wickedness of the people of Limhi, that he might discover the
means of their raising a rebellion against the
government.

Morianton 8:26
 26 And it came to pass that when Moroni had sent the
spies forth among the people of Limhi, they became more
profane; and they again returned to the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:27
 27 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent spies out
among the people of Limhi, upon the pretence that he was desirous
to know of the people who were in the city of Middoni.

Morianton 8:28
 28 But it came to pass that they did not return, but returned
again to the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:29
 29 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent
spies out upon the people of Limhi, but they returned again
to the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:30
 30 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent spies out
upon the people in the night-time, in order that he might discover their
conquest in the night-time; but he did not find them, but they
came upon him and slew him.

Morianton 8:31
 31 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent spies out of
the land of Shilom, but they did not find them, neither did
they come upon the people who were in the land of Limhi.

Morianton 8:32
 32 And Moroni again sent spies out of the land of Shilom,
concerning the people who were in the land of Limhi; but they
did not find them.

Morianton 8:33
 33 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent
spies out upon the land of Laman, but they did find them, and
they were slain; nevertheless they did come forth against
them in theheir
children, and their children should be delivered up into the
hands of those people who were in the city of Limhi; and
thus Moroni fearing the result of this measure, and also
having his heart set upon the liberty of his people, he
considered it expedient that he should send spies into the
city of Shilom to spy out the intentions and the
wickedness of the people of Limhi, that he might discover the
means of their raising a rebellion against the
government.

Morianton 8:26
 26 And it came to pass that when Moroni had sent the
spies forth among the people of Limhi, they became more
profane; and they again returned to the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:27
 27 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent spies out
among the people of Limhi, upon the pretence that he was desirous
to know of the people who were in the city of Middoni.

Morianton 8:28
 28 But it came to pass that they did not return, but returned
again to the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:29
 29 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent
spies out upon the people of Limhi, but they returned again
to the city of Shilom.

Morianton 8:30
 30 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent spies out
upon the people in the night-time, in order that he might discover their
conquest in the night-time; but he did not find them, but they
came upon him and slew him.

Morianton 8:31
 31 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent spies out of
the land of Shilom, but they did not find them, neither did
they come upon the people who were in the land of Limhi.

Morianton 8:32
 32 And Moroni again sent spies out of the land of Shilom,
concerning the people who were in the land of Limhi; but they
did not find them.

Morianton 8:33
 33 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent
spies out upon the land of Laman, but they did find them, and
they were slain; nevertheless they did come forth against
them in the night-time, and slay Moroni with a great slaughter.

Moroni 8:34
 34 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent out spies out
among the people of Limhi, and they did find and slay
Moroni; but it was the cold night of the night, and there
was nothing for the people to do but to sleep upon their
butts, and wait for the coming of the spies to slay them.

Moroni 8:35
 35 And it came to pass that Moroni sent forth his secret
affairs among the people in the night-time, and they
watched while he made ready his armies for battle,
and prepared for battle in the night-time.

Moroni 8:36
 36 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should
be lodged in the fortifications of the city of Shilom; and
he caused that spies should be made of all the people.

Moroni 8:37
 37 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that spies should
be made of the chiefs of the people; and they were to sneer
unto every man that would hearken unto his words, or that would
hearken unto the words of the servants of the people.

Moroni 8:38
 38 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the servants
of the people should be put to death; and Moroni also
sent out spies among the people unto them.

Moroni 8:39
 39 And it came to pass that the people of the city of
Shilom, when they saw that Moroni was preparing his armies for
battle, therefore they were more astonished, because of the secret
affairs of Moroni; for they knew not at the time that the
secret plans of Moroni were to be laid by the people.

Moroni 8:40
 40 For they were not to know but that Moroni and his
staff were preparing for battle against them, in the night-time,
from the day that they had been delivered out of the hands of
their prisoners.

Moroni 8:41
 41 And now I, Moroni, do not know all the cause why the
people of Limhi did not tremble before the Lord; but it was
because they knew not of Moroni and his staff, until after
they hadd slay Moroni with a great slaughter.

Moroni 8:34
 34 And it came to pass that Moroni again sent out spies out
among the people of Limhi, and they did find and slay
Moroni; but it was the cold night of the night, and there
was nothing for the people to do but to sleep upon their
butts, and wait for the coming of the spies to slay them.

Moroni 8:35
 35 And it came to pass that Moroni sent forth his secret
affairs among the people in the night-time, and they
watched while he made ready his armies for battle,
and prepared for battle in the night-time.

be lodged in the fortifications of the city of Shilom; and
he caused that spies should be made of all the people.

 37 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that spies should
be made of the chiefs of the people; and they were to sneer
unto every man that would hearken unto his words, or that would
hearken unto the words of the servants of the people.

Moroni 8:38
 38 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the servants
of the people should be put to death; and Moroni also
sent out spies among the people unto them.

Moroni 8:39
 39 And it came to pass that the people of the city of
Shilom, when they saw that Moroni was preparing his armies for
battle, therefore they were more astonished, because of the secret
affairs of Moroni; for they knew not at the time that the
secret plans of Moroni were to be laid by the people.

Moroni 8:40
 40 For they were not to know but that Moroni and his
staff were preparing for battle against them, in the night-time,
from the day that they had been delivered out of the hands of
their prisoners.

Moroni 8:41
 41 And now I, Moroni, do not know all the cause why the
people of Limhi did not tremble before the Lord; but it was
because they knew not of Moroni and his staff, until after
they had delivered them out of the hands of their prisoners.

Moroni 8:42
 42 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his people
should be loosed out of their afflictions; yea, Moroni caused that
their afflictions should be made known unto them.

Moroni 8:43
 43 And now I, Moroni, do not write all the words which Moroni
spake, for he had commanded his people that they should write the
words which he spake.

Moroni 8:44
 44 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his people
should write the words which he spake, and he caused that
their brethren should also write the words which he spake.

Moroni 8:45
 45 And when their brethren saw that they were writing the
words which he spake, they were troubled with fear, because
of the wickedness of the people.

Moroni 8:46
 46 And Moroni caused that they should be brought before the
judge; and the judge was none other than Ammon, the son of
Ammon, who was also the brother of Jared.

Moroni 8:47
 47 And the people were brought before him; and behold, the
judge was angry with them also, because of the words which
Ammon and his brethren had spoken.

Moroni 8:48
 48 But he did not strike them with the rod which he had given him,
neither he did not write the words which he spake, which were
desired of them.

Moroni 8:49
 49 Now the Spirit of the Lord was with them, and they were
caught in a strait and narrow path; and they were delivered out of
bondage, and the words which they had desired were
written by the Spirit of God.

Moroni 8:50
 50 And they also desired that the words which Ammon had
written should be read by all the people; but the Spirit of
the Lord was not with them, and they could not be heard.

Moroni 8:51
 51 And it came to pass that Ammon and his brethren
were delivered out of bondage, yea, they were delivered because
of their faith.

Moroni 8:52
 52 And it came to pass that when they had received much
persecution, they were about to perish with hunger.

should be loosed out of their afflictions; yea, Moroni caused that
their afflictions should be made known unto them.

spake, for he had commanded his people that they should write the
words which he spake.

Moroni 8:44
 44 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his people
should write the words which he spake, and he caused that
their brethren should also write the words which he spake.

Moroni 8:45
 45 And when their brethren saw that they were writing the
words which he spake, they were troubled with fear, because
of the wickedness of the people.

Moroni 8:46
 46 And Moroni caused that they should be brought before the
judge; and the judge was none other than Ammon, the son of
Ammon, who was also the brother of Jared.

Moroni 8:47
 47 And the people were brought before him; and behold, the
judge was angry with them also, because of the words which
Ammon and his brethren had spoken.

Moroni 8:48
 48 But he did not strike them with the rod which he had given him,
neither he did not write the words which he spake, which were
desired of them.

Moroni 8:49
 49 Now the Spirit of the Lord was with them, and they were
caught in a strait and narrow path; and they were delivered out of

written by the Spirit of God.

were delivered out of bondage, yea, they were delivered because
of their faith.

Moroni 8:52
 52 And it came to pass that when they had received much
persecution, they were about to perish with hunger.

Moroni 8:53
 53 But behold, Moroni, the governor of the land, at the
head of the land, had sent an army unto their assistance;
therefore, receiving strength from the Lord, they were about
to be delivered out of bondage.

Moroni 8:54
 54 And now Ammon and his brethren were living in the
wilderness, and also many of the people of the land,
because of the hardness of the hearts of the people, desired
that they would be delivered out of bondage.

Moroni 8:55
 55 But behold, it came to pass that the Spirit of the Lord
came unto them; and he said unto them: Ye have repented of
your sins, but they have hardened, insomuch that they
shall repent no more.

Moroni 8:56
 56 And it came to pass that he spake many more words unto them;
yea, and many of them did not he desire to hear.

Moroni 8:57
 57 But behold, when he had said these words, he paused upon
the earth, and proclaimed unto the people, saying:

Moroni 8:58
 58 My brethren, and also all ye ends of the earth, behold I
am he who am translated, and am sent to command this people
that they shall do these things which I have commanded them.

Moroni 8:59
 59 Behold, I am sent to command that they shall preach this
which shall be preached unto this people; and also they shall
preach it unto all the houses of Israel. And also they
shall preach it unto all nations; and except they repent
they shall be cut off from the face of the earth.

Moroni 8:60
 60 Behold, I am the voice of the Lord; and the Lord beareth
his name upon his holy arm, and upon the hairs of his
forehead; and all this shall be written, and bear
thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon the face of the earth.

Moroni 8:61
 61 But behold, this is not all; wo unto the house of Israel,
if they shall be judged according to their works. But behold
they are nothing before God, for they know him not.

Moroni 8:62
 62 Yea, everything is given them, and they have a
right to expectMoroni 8:53
 53 But behold, Moroni, the governor of the land, at the
head of the land, had sent an army unto their assistance;
therefore, receiving strength from the Lord, they were about
to be delivered out of bondage.

Moroni 8:54
 54 And now Ammon and his brethren were living in the
wilderness, and also many of the people of the land,
because of the hardness of the hearts of the people, desired
that they would be delivered out of bondage.

Moroni 8:55
 55 But behold, it came to pass that the Spirit of the Lord
came unto them; and he said unto them: Ye have repented of
your sins, but they have hardened, insomuch that they
shall repent no more.

Moroni 8:56
 56 And it came to pass that he spake many more words unto them;
yea, and many of them did not he desire to hear.

Moroni 8:57
 57 But behold, when he had said these words, he paused upon
the earth, and proclaimed unto the people, saying:

Moroni 8:58
 58 My brethren, and also all ye ends of the earth, behold I
am he who am translated, and am sent to command this people
that they shall do these things which I have commanded them.

Moroni 8:59
 59 Behold, I am sent to command that they shall preach this
which shall be preached unto this people; and also they shall
preach it unto all the houses of Israel. And also they
shall preach it unto all nations; and except they repent
they shall be cut off from the face of the earth.

Moroni 8:60
 60 Behold, I am the voice of the Lord; and the Lord beareth
his name upon his holy arm, and upon the hairs of his
forehead; and all this shall be written, and bear
thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon the face of the earth.

Moroni 8:61
 61 But behold, this is not all; wo unto the house of Israel,
if they shall be judged according to their works. But behold
they are nothing before God, for they know him not.

Moroni 8:62
 62 Yea, everything is given them, and they have a
right to expect no wrong of them; for in him they have
a place of their inheritance, of their glory, yea, even
their holiness, which is everlasting.

Moroni 8:63
 63 Yea, and all this shall be written also, and
also shall the law. And blessed are they who keep the
law and the commandments of the Lord; for these are they who are
baptized in the waters of promise, yea, they are they who are
baptized in the waters of life; and all this shall be
written and bear record.

Moroni 8:64
 64 Yea, and I am he, and these are they; yea, and this
is of them; and this shall be written and bear record,
and also shall have all that which is thereof written
and borne record.

Moroni 8:65
 65 And behold, it shall come to pass that whosoever
fraudeth of this shall be cut off from among the
people.

Moroni 8:66
 66 And now, behold, I say unto you that he that is found
frauding the people, the same shall be cut off from among the
people.

Moroni 8:67
 67 And now I, Moroni, having been made a captain over
this people, and also having had the privilege of
being a governor over this people, I know of their
corruption; and I know that they have drunk wine, and they
have committed many sins, and they are comely, and they
are prophetesses of the covenants of the Lord which he made with
them.

Moroni 8:68
 68 And I also know that they have received many revelations,
both from heaven and from the Holy Ghost; and I know that they
have all come from the beginning.

Moroni 8:69
 69 And ita saith unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in
the name of Christ, believing that ye shall receive in
it, ye shall receive in your portion.

Moroni 8:70
 70 And now, I do not say that every word of mine have been
translated into our language; but I say, they have all
been translated into our language; for the things of which I
mourn in my soul, they have been translated into our
language.

Moroni 8:71
 71 And the Lordt to expect no wrong of them; for in him they have
a place of their inheritance, of their glory, yea, even
their holiness, which is everlasting.

Moroni 8:63
 63 Yea, and all this shall be written also, and
also shall the law. And blessed are they who keep the
law and the commandments of the Lord; for these are they who are
baptized in the waters of promise, yea, they are they who are
baptized in the waters of life; and all this shall be
written and bear record.

Moroni 8:64
 64 Yea, and I am he, and these are they; yea, and this
is of them; and this shall be written and bear record,
and also shall have all that which is thereof written
and borne record.

Moroni 8:65
 65 And behold, it shall come to pass that whosoever
fraudeth of this shall be cut off from among the
people.

Moroni 8:66
 66 And now, behold, I say unto you that he that is found
frauding the people, the same shall be cut off from among the
people.

Moroni 8:67
 67 And now I, Moroni, having been made a captain over
this people, and also having had the privilege of
being a governor over this people, I know of their
corruption; and I know that they have drunk wine, and they
have committed many sins, and they are comely, and they

 70 And now, I do not say that every word of mine have been
translated into our language; but I say, they have all
been translated into our language; for the things of which I
mourn in my soul, they have been translated into our
language.

Moroni 8:71
 71 And the Lord hath said: I will raise up seed unto you by the
earth, according to the number of the tribes of Israel; and they
shall be scattered throughout all the face of the earth,
according to the number of their tribes.

Moroni 8:72
 72 Therefore, as the Lord liveth, thou shalt be in thy seed, and
thy seed shall be scattered.

Moroni 8:73
 73 Thou shalt be hated of all men, and shall be laughed at,
scattered, and devoured by all nations.

Moroni 8:74
 74 For the Lord hath said: I will establish my covenant with the
earth; and I will establish my throne over the earth; and I will
be merciful unto the children of men.

Moroni 8:75
 75 Behold, I am he; and I am he that created all things.
And I am he that created all things in the earth.

Moroni 8:76
 76 Thou art I; thou art I that created.

Moroni 8:77
 77 Behold, the works of thy hands are all done; and even the
manner of thy fingers are upon the works of thy hands.

Moroni 8:78
 78 And I am I that created--that being that created of
all the earth.

Moroni 8:79
 79 Thou art that same being who was created by the power of
the air--that same being, I, who am thy God.

Moroni 8:80
 80 Behold, I am very young; yet am my father the Lord thy
Lord.

Moroni 8:81
 81 Behold, I am obedient unto him who sent me to command
thy servants to flee before the people of the land.

Moroni 8:82
 82 Behold, I am a servant of the Father, and am sent to command
thy servants to flee before the
people of the land.

Moroni 8:83
 83 I am sent to command thy servants to flee before the
people of the land.

Moroni 8:84
 84 For the land is filled with the grip of the wicked,
which is to take away the wicked from among the people, to
be devoured by wild beasts, and flocks of every kind, and
to be sick among beasts.

Moroni 8ave been translated into our
language.

Moroni 8:71
 71 And the Lord hath said: I will raise up seed unto you by the
earth, according to the number of the tribes of Israel; and they
shall be scattered throughout all the face of the earth,
according to the number of their tribes.

Moroni 8:72
 72 Therefore, as the Lord liveth, thou shalt be in thy seed, and
thy seed shall be scattered.

Moroni 8:73

And I am he that created all things in the earth.

Moroni 8:76
 76 Thou art I; thou art I that created.

Moroni 8:77
 77 Behold, the works of thy hands are all done; and even the
manner of thy fingers are upon the works of thy hands.

Moroni 8:78

Moroni 8:81
 81 Behold, I am obedient unto him who sent me to command
thy servants to flee before the people of the land.

Moroni 8:82
 82 Behold, I am a servant of the Father, and am sent to command
thy servants to flee before the
people of the land.

Moroni 8:83
 83 I am sent to command thy servants to flee before the
people of the land.

Moroni 8:84
 84 For the land is filled with the grip of the wicked,
which is to take away the wicked from among the people, to
be devoured by wild beasts, and flocks of every kind, and
to be sick among beasts.

Moroni 8:85
 85 Behold, I am the crafty artificer; the master
who is at work in my flesh is the arm of the Lord of Hosts.

Moroni 8:86
 86 Behold, the Lord of Hosts is in the east; and I, who am
thy servant, am he in the west.

Moroni 8:87
 87 And the Lord of Hosts is before thee; thou shalt not
rejoice in them, nor sorrow in them, nor lay hold
upon them, nor bring them forth, nor set them up, nor
praise them, nor glorify them, nor glorify the name of
the Lord.

Moroni 8:88
 88 Behold, the Lord of Hosts is before thee, the same that sent
me.

Moroni 8:89
 89 And the Lord of Hosts is also, and cometh to a
concubines in captivity; and the Lord of Hosts is his name.

Moroni 8:90
 90 Behold, he hath brought forth thousands of years from the
dead, and also he hath brought forth thousands of years from the
dead, and also hath he brought forth thousands of years from the
dead.

Moroni 8:91
 91 And the fool loveth his bread and his wine, but the righteous
hath he that bread and that wine, which he shall give up unto
his neighbor.

Moroni 8:92
 92 And I, Moroni, write a few of the words which I have
written, and proceed to write the remainder.

Moroni 8:93
 93 Behold, I write the words of Isaiah, the son of Amoz.

Moroni 8:94
 94 I have not read the books yet, but I have heard that the
prophets have written them; and I have read the scriptures many
times, but I do not remember distinctly what I have read.

Moroni 8:95
 95 But I do remember that the scriptures are given unto the children
of men, and they are written by those who are of the house of
Israel.

Moroni 8:96
 96 And I know that they are of the house of Israel; but I do not
know their author. I know that they have been spoken ofs, and flocks of every kind, and
to be sick among beasts.

Moroni 8:85
 85 Behold, I am the crafty artificer; the master
who is at work in my flesh is the arm of the Lord of Hosts.

Moroni 8:86
 86 Behold, the Lord of Hosts is in the east; and I, who am
thy servant, am he in the west.

Moroni 8:87
 87 And the Lord of Hosts is before thee; thou shalt not
rejoice in them, nor sorrow in them, nor lay hold
upon them, nor bring them forth, nor set them up, nor
praise them, nor glorify them, nor glorify the name of
the Lord.

Moroni 8:88
 88 Behold, the Lord of Hosts is before thee, the same that sent
me.

Moroni 8:89
 89 And the Lord of Hosts is also, and cometh to a
concubines in captivity; and the Lord of Hosts is his name.

Moroni 8:90
 90 Behold, he hath brought forth thousands of years from the
dead, and also he hath brought forth thousands of years from the
dead, and also hath he brought forth thousands of years from the
dead.

Moroni 8:91
 91 And the fool loveth his bread and his wine, but the righteous
hath he that bread and that wine, which he shall give up unto
his neighbor.

Moroni 8:92
 92 And I, Moroni, write a few of the words which I have
written, and proceed to write the remainder.

Moroni 8:93
 93 Behold, I write the words of Isaiah, the son of Amoz.

Moroni 8:94
 94 I have not read the books yet, but I have heard that the
prophets have written them; and I have read the scriptures many
times, but I do not remember distinctly what I have read.

Moroni 8:95
 95 But I do remember that the scriptures are given unto the children
of men, and they are written by those who are of the house of
Israel.

Moroni 8:96
 96 And I know that they are of the house of Israel; but I do not
know their author. I know that they have been spoken of by the
earlier prophets.

Moroni 8:97
 97 And again, I know that Jesus Christ shall come in his
own due time, and shall manifest himself unto the children of men,
according to the things which have been spoken concerning him
concerning the things which shall be done among the children of
man.

Moroni 8:98
 98 And now, I write the words of Isaiah, the son of Amoz.

Moroni 8:99
 99 And it came to pass that after I had written these words,
that my father consulted with the Lord, concerning the words which
he should write.

Moroni 8:100
 100 And it came to pass that he spake many things unto the Lord,
concerning the words which he should write.

Moroni 8:101
 101 And after the Lord had heard them he said unto the Lord:
Blessed art thou, Lord, our God, with regard unto this thing, which
thou hast done.

Moroni 8:102
 102 And blessed is the name of the Lord in heaven above
concerning this thing.

Moroni 8:103
 103 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort
my mother Sariah, concerning us, which were the children of the
wicked woman.

Moroni 8:104
 104 And it came to pass that they did speak many things unto
the Lord, which were written in the book of the prophets.

Moroni 8:105
 105 And it came to pass that they did speak many things unto the
Lord, which were written by the prophet Isaiah.

Moroni 8:106
 106 And it came to pass that they did speak many things unto the
Lord concerning the things which they had both seen and
heard.

Moroni 8:107
 107 And they did say unto the Lord: What meaneth these things which
we have both seen and heard, that they should be written and brought
forth unto the people?

Moroni 8:108
 108 And the Lord said unto them: Let them be written and
remembered, that they shall be written and brought forth
unto the people;

Moroni 8:109
 109 And they shall be written in the hearts of the children of
men, even unto the end of the earth.us Christ shall come in his
own due time, and shall manifest himself unto the children of men,
according to the things which have been spoken concerning him
concerning the things which shall be done among the children of
man.

Moroni 8:98
 98 And now, I write the words of Isaiah, the son of Amoz.

Moroni 8:99
 99 And it came to pass that after I had written these words,
that my father consulted with the Lord, concerning the words which
he should write.

Moroni 8:100
 100 And it came to pass that he spake many things unto the Lord,
concerning the words which he should write.

Moroni 8:101
 101 And after the Lord had heard them he said unto the Lord:
Blessed art thou, Lord, our God, with regard unto this thing, which
thou hast done.

Moroni 8:102
 102 And blessed is the name of the Lord in heaven above
concerning this thing.

Moroni 8:103
 103 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort
my mother Sariah, concerning us, which were the children of the
wicked woman.

Moroni 8:104
 104 And it came to pass that they did speak many things unto
the Lord, which were written in the book of the prophets.

Moroni 8:105
 105 And it came to pass that they did speak many things unto the
Lord, which were written by the prophet Isaiah.

Moroni 8:106
 106 And it came to pass that they did speak many things unto the
Lord concerning the things which they had both seen and
heard.

Moroni 8:107
 107 And they did say unto the Lord: What meaneth these things which
we have both seen and heard, that they should be written and brought
forth unto the people?

Moroni 8:108
 108 And the Lord said unto them: Let them be written and
remembered, that they shall be written and brought forth
unto the people;

Moroni 8:109
 109 And they shall be written in the hearts of the children of
men, even unto the end of the earth.

Moroni 8:110
 110 Nevertheless, I command thee that thou shalt not write them
until after they shall be written unto the children of men.

Moroni 8:111
 111 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my mother that she
should seal up the things which she had seen, that the people
might not read them, that they might not have a record
of the things which they had both seen and heard.

Moroni 8:112
 112 And behold, the Lord commanded that she should seal up the
transmissions of the records unto the children of men, that they
should be kept, that the records of the kings of Israel might
not be made public.

Moroni 8:113
 113 And it came to pass that my mother did seal them up, that
thereby the Lord might preserve them from the persecutions of
the people.

Moroni 8:114
 114 But the Lord commanded my father, Lehi, that he should not seal up the
transmissions of the records unto the children of men until he should
have made a record of the things which he had both seen and
heard.

Moroni 8:115
 115 And yet, I, Moroni, write what I write among my people,
which records I make with mine own hands; and now I make an end of my
speaking.

Moroni 9
Chapter 9

Moroni 9:1
 1 And now I, Moroni, write what I write among my people, which
records I make with mine own hands, of my father, Nephi.

Moroni 9:2
 2 Nephi would speak somewhat concerning these records and these
transmissions. Behold, I have not written them down in my
manuscript, neither do I have them in the book; for I know not
when or what I shall write them.

Moroni 9:3
 3 Behold, I make them by the power of the Spirit; therefore after they
have been received and examined by the priests of the Lord, they
are hid up until the coming of the Messiah.

Moroni 9:4
 4 Behold, I make them by the power of the Spirit; nevertheless after
they have been hid up until the coming of the Messiah
they shall be made manifest unto the children of men.

Moroni 9:5
 5 And behold, the children of men are the rulers over this
government; therefore they know the thoughts of their fathers.

Moroni 9:n unto the children of men.

Moroni 8:111
 111 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my mother that she
should seal up the things which she had seen, that the people
might not read them, that they might not have a record
of the things which they had both seen and heard.

Moroni 8:112
 112 And behold, the Lord commanded that she should seal up the
transmissions of the records unto the children of men, that they
should be kept, that the records of the kings of Israel might
not be made public.

Moroni 8:113
 113 And it came to pass that my mother did seal them up, that
thereby the Lord might preserve them from the persecutions of
the people.

Moroni 8:114
 114 But the Lord commanded my father, Lehi, that he should not seal up the
transmissions of the records unto the children of men until he should
have made a record of the things which he had both seen and
heard.

Moroni 8:115
 115 And yet, I, Moroni, write what I write among my people,
which records I make with mine own hands; and now I make an end of my
speaking.

Moroni 9
Chapter 9

Moroni 9:1
 1 And now I, Moroni, write what I write among my people, which
records I make with mine own hands, of my father, Nephi.

Moroni 9:2
 2 Nephi would speak somewhat concerning these records and these
transmissions. Behold, I have not written them down in my
manuscript, neither do I have them in the book; for I know not
when or what I shall write them.

Moroni 9:3
 3 Behold, I make them by the power of the Spirit; therefore after they
have been received and examined by the priests of the Lord, they
are hid up until the coming of the Messiah.

Moroni 9:4
 4 Behold, I make them by the power of the Spirit; nevertheless after
they have been hid up until the coming of the Messiah
they shall be made manifest unto the children of men.

Moroni 9:5
 5 And behold, the children of men are the rulers over this
government; therefore they know the thoughts of their fathers.

Moroni 9:6
 6 Therefore behold, they who are of the house of Israel shall be
rulers over this people, and shall establish peace upon the face of the
earth; yea, even upon the face of all the earth.

Moroni 9:7
 7 And behold, this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded
me--that I should do.

Moroni 9:8
 8 And behold the Lord hath commanded me that I should speak many
things unto this people, that they may know concerning the
coming of the Messiah.

Moroni 9:9
 9 And they who are of the house of Israel shall be established upon
the land of Jerusalem; and upon the land of Judah shall they be
established.

Moroni 9:10
 10 And they who are of the house of Israel shall be exalted in the
pride of the nations; then shall they be numbered among the children of
men, and shall be distinguished from them by their righteousness, and
their faith, and by their righteousness' fruit; and so they shall
be scattered among all nations.

Moroni 9:11
 11 Yea, they shall be among the children of men, and shall be
exceeded and loved of the most men; then shall they praise the name of the
Lord, and they shall sing to his praise; yea, they shall be
blessed; and they shall be gathered together to sing to his praise
meek, humble, and naked, and aloof from all the company of
men.

Moroni 9:12
 12 Yea, they shall be among those who are as a garment tossed
into the wind, or as a man without countenance, without beheld,
yet full of grace and mercy, and yet full of the Holy Ghost, so
that he can know of them not.

Moroni 9:13
 13 Behold, I write these things unto the children of men, that
they may know of the coming of the Messiah, that
they may know from whence he come, and that they may be
considered of the Lord, according to their works.

Moroni 9:14
 14 But behold, these things shall be written unto the
children of men, that they may know of a surety that the Lord
cometh in the flesh, and that he shall show himself unto
them.

Moroni 9oni 9:6
 6 Therefore behold, they who are of the house of Israel shall be
rulers over this people, and shall establish peace upon the face of the
earth; yea, even upon the face of all the earth.

Moroni 9:7
 7 And behold, this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded
me--that I should do.

Moroni 9:8
 8 And behold the Lord hath commanded me that I should speak many
things unto this people, that they may know concerning the
coming of the Messiah.

Moroni 9:9
 9 And they who are of the house of Israel shall be established upon
the land of Jerusalem; and upon the land of Judah shall they be
established.

Moroni 9:10
 10 And they who are of the house of Israel shall be exalted in the
pride of the nations; then shall they be numbered among the children of
men, and shall be distinguished from them by their righteousness, and
their faith, and by their righteousness' fruit; and so they shall
be scattered among all nations.

Moroni 9:11
 11 Yea, they shall be among the children of men, and shall be
exceeded and loved of the most men; then shall they praise the name of the
Lord, and they shall sing to his praise; yea, they shall be
blessed; and they shall be gathered together to sing to his praise
meek, humble, and naked, and aloof from all the company of
men.

Moroni 9:12
 12 Yea, they shall be among those who are as a garment tossed
into the wind, or as a man without countenance, without beheld,
yet full of grace and mercy, and yet full of the Holy Ghost, so
that he can know of them not.

Moroni 9:13
 13 Behold, I write these things unto the children of men, that
they may know of the coming of the Messiah, that
they may know from whence he come, and that they may be
considered of the Lord, according to their works.

Moroni 9:14
 14 But behold, these things shall be written unto the
children of men, that they may know of a surety that the Lord
cometh in the flesh, and that he shall show himself unto
them.

Moroni 9:15
 15 Yea, these things shall be written unto them, that they
may know of a surety, that the Lord cometh in the flesh not,
not in the flesh but in the spirit, to manifest himself unto
them according to their works.

Moroni 9:16
 16 Now I, Moroni, write a few of these things, that I might
know of a surety to speak the remainder; but I fear that I
must deliver up the record unto my father Moroni. Amen.

Moroni 10
Chapter 10

Moroni 10:1
 1 Behold, it came to pass that after the record was
brought to the knowledge of the people, that the Lord spake
unto Ahab, saying:

Moroni 10:2
 2 Ahab, I pray thee, thou hast read the records which I have
commanded thee; thou hast also read the commandments of thy father.

Moroni 10:3
 3 Thou hast also heard the words of this prophet, which he
spake concerning the restoration of the records unto the people,
and also concerning the restoration of all that which had been
brought out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 10:4
 4 Wherefore, I, Ahab, do command thee that thou should
receive these things according to the record which thou hast
seen me read.

Moroni 10:5
 5 But Ahab repented not of the things which he had read, for
he saw them not; nevertheless, he would not hearken to the
words of the prophet; therefore, he did not receive the things which
the prophet had commanded him.

Moroni 10:6
 6 And after this manner did Ahab keep his heart; for he did harden
his heart, even to a hardness not uniting with idolatry.

Moroni 10:7
 7 And it came to pass that when he had eaten his fill he
began to make his own clothes, and also those which had been torn
from the body of the dead.

Moroni 10:8
 8 Yea, even he began to make his garment after his manner,
and he did put on ties of silver, and he did put on fine
closets, and all manner of fine clothes.

Moroni 10:9
 9 And it came to, and that he shall show himself unto
them.

Moroni 9:15
 15 Yea, these things shall be written unto them, that they
may know of a surety, that the Lord cometh in the flesh not,
not in the flesh but in the spirit, to manifest himself unto
them according to their works.

Moroni 9:16
 16 Now I, Moroni, write a few of these things, that I might
know of a surety to speak the remainder; but I fear that I
must deliver up the record unto my father Moroni. Amen.

Moroni 10
Chapter 10

Moroni 10:1
 1 Behold, it came to pass that after the record was
brought to the knowledge of the people, that the Lord spake
unto Ahab, saying:

Moroni 10:2
 2 Ahab, I pray thee, thou hast read the records which I have
commanded thee; thou hast also read the commandments of thy father.

Moroni 10:3
 3 Thou hast also heard the words of this prophet, which he
spake concerning the restoration of the records unto the people,
and also concerning the restoration of all that which had been
brought out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 10:4
 4 Wherefore, I, Ahab, do command thee that thou should
receive these things according to the record which thou hast
seen me read.

Moroni 10:5
 5 But Ahab repented not of the things which he had read, for
he saw them not; nevertheless, he would not hearken to the
words of the prophet; therefore, he did not receive the things which
the prophet had commanded him.

Moroni 10:6
 6 And after this manner did Ahab keep his heart; for he did harden
his heart, even to a hardness not uniting with idolatry.

Moroni 10:7
 7 And it came to pass that when he had eaten his fill he
began to make his own clothes, and also those which had been torn
from the body of the dead.

Moroni 10:8
 8 Yea, even he began to make his garment after his manner,
and he did put on ties of silver, and he did put on fine
closets, and all manner of fine clothes.

Moroni 10:9
 9 And it came to pass that he gave unto men to make of
fine clothes, many of whom were in the city of Jerusalem,
or in the land of Ishmael, and they were not of the Lamanites.

Moroni 10:10
 10 And it came to pass that they were converted unto the Lord,
yea, and were called by the name of Nephites, and were
converted unto the Lord, and were called by the name of people of the Lord,
nevertheless, they were not called Nephites.

Moroni 10:11
 11 But they were called people of the Lord, and they were
converted unto the Lord, and were called by the name of people of the Lord;
nevertheless, they were not called the people of the Lord, for they
were not of the house of Israel.

Moroni 10:12
 12 And I, Moroni, did cause them to be called the people of the Lord,
even that they should be called the people of the Lord, in the
same name.

Moroni 10:13
 13 But behold, they were not so called; but they were called by
this name, the people of the Lord.

Moroni 10:14
 14 Wherefore, I, Moroni, did cause that their names should
be changed, that they might be distinct; and this I did that I
might be separate from them, that they might not be conjoined
towards the garden of destruction.

Moroni 10:15
 15 Wherefore, I, Moroni, did take them, and they were carried
before the people, and read them.

Moroni 10:16
 16 And when the people had all read them, the Lord said unto
Moroni: Behold, this is the record which I have commanded thee.

Moroni 10:17
 17 Now I do not write the things of my heart, for I do not
remember the things which I have written.

Moroni 10:18
 18 And I do not remember the things of my father. Wherefore,
he saw the Lord.

Moroni 10:19
 19 And I write these things that the Lord God may remember
me in mine other record.

Moroni 10:20
 20 Behold, I know that the thingsl manner of fine clothes.

Moroni 10:9
 9 And it came to pass that he gave unto men to make of
fine clothes, many of whom were in the city of Jerusalem,
or in the land of Ishmael, and they were not of the Lamanites.

Moroni 10:10
 10 And it came to pass that they were converted unto the Lord,
yea, and were called by the name of Nephites, and were
converted unto the Lord, and were called by the name of people of the Lord,
nevertheless, they were not called Nephites.

Moroni 10:11
 11 But they were called people of the Lord, and they were
converted unto the Lord, and were called by the name of people of the Lord;
nevertheless, they were not called the people of the Lord, for they
were not of the house of Israel.

Moroni 10:12
 12 And I, Moroni, did cause them to be called the people of the Lord,
even that they should be called the people of the Lord, in the
same name.

Moroni 10:13
 13 But behold, they were not so called; but they were called by
this name, the people of the Lord.

Moroni 10:14
 14 Wherefore, I, Moroni, did cause that their names should
be changed, that they might be distinct; and this I did that I
might be separate from them, that they might not be conjoined
towards the garden of destruction.

Moroni 10:15
 15 Wherefore, I, Moroni, did take them, and they were carried
before the people, and read them.

Moroni 10:16
 16 And when the people had all read them, the Lord said unto
Moroni: Behold, this is the record which I have commanded thee.

Moroni 10:17
 17 Now I do not write the things of my heart, for I do not
remember the things which I have written.

Moroni 10:18
 18 And I do not remember the things of my father. Wherefore,
he saw the Lord.

Moroni 10:19
 19 And I write these things that the Lord God may remember
me in mine other record.

Moroni 10:20
 20 Behold, I know that the things of which I write,
according to the spirit of revelation, have been of great worth in
the things of my father.

Moroni 10:21
 21 Nevertheless, the things which I write are of greater worth,
because of the many revelations which have been given by the
voice of the Lord unto me, by which I have been made known of
the things which my fathers knew not concerning.

Moroni 10:22
 22 Wherefore, I write these things that the Lord God may
remember me in mine other record, which reigned in the
thirtieth year from the coming of Christ.

Moroni 10:23
 23 Behold, I am Mormon. I am a Mormon, and a descendant of the
first born among the Nephites.

Moroni 10:24
 24 And behold, I am a man of the Spirit, and a man of God. I am
converted unto the Lord after the manner of the other converts;
therefore, I write these things that the Lord God may remember
me in mine other record.

Moroni 10:25
 25 Behold, I am commanded of the Lord that these things should be
written.

Moroni 10:26
 26 Behold, I am Omer. I am a descendant of the first born of
Jacob. I am a man of the Spirit. I am a man of God. I
am an apostle of the Lamb.

Moroni 10:27
 27 I am called according to that which I have written. I am
converted upon the Lamb.

Moroni 10:28
 28 And behold, I am sent to preach unto all nations, kindreds, and
people, that they may know of the Lamb. I am he who shall
come, the Lamb of God.

Moroni 10:29
 29 Wherefore, upon this wise did he come, according to the
voice of the angel, he being desirous that all men should know
him, that all men might know him that they might be afflicted only
according to their afflictions.

Moroni 10:30
 30 And as he sat upon his throne, so shall they that shall
stand in his judgment suffer his sword, and his power, according to
their iniquities.

Moroni 10:31
 31 Wherefore, I write these things that the Lord Godhich I write,
according to the spirit of revelation, have been of great worth in
the things of my father.

Moroni 10:21
 21 Nevertheless, the things which I write are of greater worth,
because of the many revelations which have been given by the
voice of the Lord unto me, by which I have been made known of
the things which my fathers knew not concerning.

Moroni 10:22
 22 Wherefore, I write these things that the Lord God may
remember me in mine other record, which reigned in the
thirtieth year from the coming of Christ.

Moroni 10:23
 23 Behold, I am Mormon. I am a Mormon, and a descendant of the
first born among the Nephites.

Moroni 10:24
 24 And behold, I am a man of the Spirit, and a man of God. I am
converted unto the Lord after the manner of the other converts;
therefore, I write these things that the Lord God may remember
me in mine other record.

Moroni 10:25
 25 Behold, I am commanded of the Lord that these things should be
written.

Moroni 10:26
 26 Behold, I am Omer. I am a descendant of the first born of
Jacob. I am a man of the Spirit. I am a man of God. I
am an apostle of the Lamb.

Moroni 10:27
 27 I am called according to that which I have written. I am
converted upon the Lamb.

Moroni 10:28
 28 And behold, I am sent to preach unto all nations, kindreds, and
people, that they may know of the Lamb. I am he who shall
come, the Lamb of God.

Moroni 10:29
 29 Wherefore, upon this wise did he come, according to the
voice of the angel, he being desirous that all men should know
him, that all men might know him that they might be afflicted only
according to their afflictions.

Moroni 10:30
 30 And as he sat upon his throne, so shall they that shall
stand in his judgment suffer his sword, and his power, according to
their iniquities.

Moroni 10:31
 31 Wherefore, I write these things that the Lord God may
remember me in mine other record.

Moroni 10:32
 32 And now I, Mormon, would speak somewhat concerning the things
which my father hath written. Behold, after my father had
written the thirty and second Psalm, he sent it among all the
people of the Lord, which was partaking of his holy ordinance,
yea, all the house of Israel.

Moroni 10:33
 33 And behold, it was commanded him that the records which
were engraven on the plates of brass should be kept and handed down
from one generation to another;

Moroni 10:34
 34 That the people, who were at Jerusalem, should know concerning
the things which my father hath written.

Moroni 10:35
 35 And also that the records should be handed down by the
hand of the Lord from generation to generation; or, in other words,
that the people who were at Jerusalem should know concerning these
things, even down to the time my father left Jerusalem.

Moroni 10:36
 36 And he said unto them: Behold, I have translated the records
of my father, which were on the plates of brass.

Moroni 10:37
 37 And now I, Mormon, write the records which my father hath
written according to his words. And I write these things
that the people, who are at Jerusalem, may know concerning
these things.

Moroni 10:38
 38 And it came to pass that he spake many more things unto the
people of the city, even to the King, who had been the last
concubine; and he spake also concerning the other captives, the
women and the children who had been carried away into the land of
Middoni.

Moroni 10:39
 39 And he spake also concerning the captivity of Alma, who
had been the son of Alma.

Moroni 10:40
 40 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people
of Nephi.

Moroni 10:41
 41 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Jacob; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:42
 42 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people
of Joseph.

Moroni 10:43
 43 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Jesusrmon, would speak somewhat concerning the things
which my father hath written. Behold, after my father had
written the thirty and second Psalm, he sent it among all the
people of the Lord, which was partaking of his holy ordinance,
yea, all the house of Israel.

Moroni 10:33
 33 And behold, it was commanded him that the records which
were engraven on the plates of brass should be kept and handed down
from one generation to another;

Moroni 10:34
 34 That the people, who were at Jerusalem, should know concerning
the things which my father hath written.

Moroni 10:35
 35 And also that the records should be handed down by the
hand of the Lord from generation to generation; or, in other words,
that the people who were at Jerusalem should know concerning these
things, even down to the time my father left Jerusalem.

Moroni 10:36
 36 And he said unto them: Behold, I have translated the records
of my father, which were on the plates of brass.

Moroni 10:37
 37 And now I, Mormon, write the records which my father hath
written according to his words. And I write these things
that the people, who are at Jerusalem, may know concerning
these things.

Moroni 10:38
 38 And it came to pass that he spake many more things unto the
people of the city, even to the King, who had been the last
concubine; and he spake also concerning the other captives, the
women and the children who had been carried away into the land of
Middoni.

Moroni 10:39
 39 And he spake also concerning the captivity of Alma, who
had been the son of Alma.

Moroni 10:40
 40 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people
of Nephi.

Moroni 10:41
 41 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Jacob; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:42
 42 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people
of Joseph.

Moroni 10:43
 43 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Jesus; but this I do not write in this book.

Moroni 10:44
 44 And he spake concerning the captivity of the people of
Samaria; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:45
 45 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Judah; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:46
 46 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Ammon; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:47
 47 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Jacob; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:48
 48 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Samaria; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:49
 49 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Ishmael; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:50
 50 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Ammon; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 11
Chapter 11

Moroni 11:1
 1 And it came to pass that all these things of old time did pass
away; and they were in the days of Abinadi; and many years
had passed away since the captivity of his father.

Moroni 11:2
 2 And it came to pass that he also, who was the son of Alma,
separated from the people of the Lord, leaving the land of Middoni
forever.

Moroni 11:3
 3 And also Alma did not live to see his days, but he did rest
himself in the land of Ammonihah, and also in the land of Jershon;
for he had many children by the wives and concubines of the
Lord.

Moroni 11:4
 4 And now I, Moroni, write the record of my father, who was the
son of Alma; neither have I any more desire to write the record
of my father, who was the son of Alma.

Moroni 11:5
 5 Behold, he died in the first year of his age, in the
age of fourteen years; and behold, I did write the records
of my father, which had been kept by the people ofng the captivity of the people of
Jesus; but this I do not write in this book.

Moroni 10:44
 44 And he spake concerning the captivity of the people of
Samaria; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:45
 45 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Judah; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:46
 46 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Ammon; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:47
 47 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Jacob; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:48
 48 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Samaria; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:49
 49 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of
Ishmael; but I do not write them in this book.

Moroni 10:50
 50 And he spake also concerning the captivity of the people of

Chapter 11

Moroni 11:1
 1 And it came to pass that all these things of old time did pass
away; and they were in the days of Abinadi; and many years
had passed away since the captivity of his father.

Moroni 11:2
 2 And it came to pass that he also, who was the son of Alma,
separated from the people of the Lord, leaving the land of Middoni
forever.

Moroni 11:3
 3 And also Alma did not live to see his days, but he did rest
himself in the land of Ammonihah, and also in the land of Jershon;
for he had many children by the wives and concubines of the
Lord.

Moroni 11:4
 4 And now I, Moroni, write the record of my father, who was the
son of Alma; neither have I any more desire to write the record
of my father, who was the son of Alma.

Moroni 11:5
 5 Behold, he died in the first year of his age, in the
age of fourteen years; and behold, I did write the records
of my father, which had been kept by the people of the
Lord from the time that he left Jerusalem.

Moroni 11:6
 6 And now I, Moroni, write the last record which my father
preserved; for behold, he lived to see the destruction of the
people of the Lord.

Moroni 11:7
 7 And it came to pass that he did receive many descendants,
among whom were a great many who were desirous to see the
destruction of the people of the Lord.

Moroni 11:8
 8 And it came to pass that they came down in a body,
according to their desires, to the place of Middoni; and they
went in unto the Lord, and began to speak unto him.

Moroni 11:9
 9 And it came to pass that the Lord did judge them, and
condemn them, that they became unclean, and they could not
be among the people; therefore they went out of the land
of Middoni, even to the wilderness which was northward,
and did again return to the land of Jershon.

Moroni 11:10
 10 And my father, having witnessed the destruction of the
people of the Lord, he became desirous to know of the
mother of all expostulations against him.

Moroni 11:11
 11 Now my fathers (for he truly wrote many things down) had
noticed these things; therefore, my father, Alma, having read
all the scriptures to the children of men, he came and stood
before the Lord, and began to expound the scriptures unto them.

Moroni 11:12
 12 And he said unto them: How knowest thou the chief
judge, the man that shall stand to judge the land, the man
that shall be judged of the land, and shall be set at the
judgment-seat of the world?

Moroni 11:13
 13 Thou hast read all this unto them; therefore, all this
desire shall be fulfilled. Now, the chief judge, and the
man that shall be judged--these are they which shall be
judged of the land, and shall be set at the judgment-seat of
the world.

Moroni 11:14
 14 How knowest thou the father, which had been kept by the people of the
Lord from the time that he left Jerusalem.

Moroni 11:6
 6 And now I, Moroni, write the last record which my father
preserved; for behold, he lived to see the destruction of the
people of the Lord.

Moroni 11:7
 7 And it came to pass that he did receive many descendants,
among whom were a great many who were desirous to see the
destruction of the people of the Lord.

Moroni 11:8
 8 And it came to pass that they came down in a body,
according to their desires, to the place of Middoni; and they
went in unto the Lord, and began to speak unto him.

Moroni 11:9
 9 And it came to pass that the Lord did judge them, and
condemn them, that they became unclean, and they could not
be among the people; therefore they went out of the land
of Middoni, even to the wilderness which was northward,
and did again return to the land of Jershon.

Moroni 11:10
 10 And my father, having witnessed the destruction of the
people of the Lord, he became desirous to know of the
mother of all expostulations against him.

Moroni 11:11
 11 Now my fathers (for he truly wrote many things down) had
noticed these things; therefore, my father, Alma, having read
all the scriptures to the children of men, he came and stood
before the Lord, and began to expound the scriptures unto them.

Moroni 11:12
 12 And he said unto them: How knowest thou the chief
judge, the man that shall stand to judge the land, the man
that shall be judged of the land, and shall be set at the
judgment-seat of the world?

Moroni 11:13
 13 Thou hast read all this unto them; therefore, all this
desire shall be fulfilled. Now, the chief judge, and the
man that shall be judged--these are they which shall be
judged of the land, and shall be set at the judgment-seat of
the world.

Moroni 11:14
 14 How knowest thou the chief Shepherd, the Lamb of
God, who shall take away the scourged?

Moroni 11:15
 15 Behold, he has come down among the children of men;

Moroni 11:16
 16 Behold, he is the father of all righteousness; yea, all
this day have I taught my children concerning him,
even as I have taught them concerning the Messiah.

Moroni 11:17
 17 For behold, he cometh in the fulness of time to redeem his
sons.

Moroni 11:18
 18 And there is none other Messiah, neither hath any other
prophets been spoken concerning.

Moroni 11:19
 19 Behold, he is come unto the world to redeem his people;
and he saveth them not, neither do they judge him. Behold, there
is none other such thing as justice. Behold, there is no other
thing save it be according to our faith concerning the Messiah.

Moroni 11:20
 20 Knoweth thy paternity, O house of Israel.

Moroni 11:21
 21 Behold, thy father cometh in the days of thy youth in
the latter days of this same year.

Moroni 11:22
 22 And behold, I have sent among them, to call them to the
knowledge of the Messiah, which is near at hand; wherefore, it
shall come to pass, that it shall be made known unto them according to
their children.

Moroni 11:23
 23 For behold, I have prayed unto the Father that he might know
concerning thy affairs, that thou mightest know of the things of
thy fathers.

Moroni 11:24
 24 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying:

Moroni 11:25
 25 Yea, I know thy thoughts, O house of Israel. I have beheld
thy thoughts, even as thou hast beheld mine intended things.

Moroni 11:26
 26 Wherefore, because thou hast beheld my intended things, thou
knowest that I know them also. And if these things so be that
thy children live to see the day of judgment, they must surely
see it.

Moroni 11:27
 27 Yea, and my soul delighteth in the day of that damnation;
nevertheless, my soul delighteth in the redemption of my
fathers.

ho shall take away the scourged?

Moroni 11:15
 15 Behold, he has come down among the children of men;

Moroni 11:16
 16 Behold, he is the father of all righteousness; yea, all
this day have I taught my children concerning him,
even as I have taught them concerning the Messiah.

Moroni 11:17
 17 For behold, he cometh in the fulness of time to redeem his
sons.

Moroni 11:18
 18 And there is none other Messiah, neither hath any other
prophets been spoken concerning.

Moroni 11:19
 19 Behold, he is come unto the world to redeem his people;
and he saveth them not, neither do they judge him. Behold, there
is none other such thing as justice. Behold, there is no other
thing save it be according to our faith concerning the Messiah.

Moroni 11:20
 20 Knoweth thy paternity, O house of Israel.

Moroni 11:21
 21 Behold, thy father cometh in the days of thy youth in
the latter days of this same year.

Moroni 11:22
 22 And behold, I have sent among them, to call them to the
knowledge of the Messiah, which is near at hand; wherefore, it
shall come to pass, that it shall be made known unto them according to
their children.

Moroni 11:23
 23 For behold, I have prayed unto the Father that he might know
concerning thy affairs, that thou mightest know of the things of
thy fathers.

Moroni 11:24
 24 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying:

Moroni 11:25
 25 Yea, I know thy thoughts, O house of Israel. I have beheld
thy thoughts, even as thou hast beheld mine intended things.

Moroni 11:26
 26 Wherefore, because thou hast beheld my intended things, thou
knowest that I know them also. And if these things so be that
thy children live to see the day of judgment, they must surely
see it.

Moroni 11:27
 27 Yea, and my soul delighteth in the day of that damnation;
nevertheless, my soul delighteth in the redemption of my
fathers.

Chapter 1

Mosiah 1:1
 1 Now I, Mosiah, do not write the history of the king of the
Branch of Judea. I have not the heart to write it; for I know that
the things which I write are not the whole history of my father.

Mosiah 1:2
 2 And he spake concerning the destruction of his people; and it
came to pass that after he had spoken these words he
remembered the words which he had spoken unto the people, and
they were angry with him.

Mosiah 1:3
 3 And he said: I did not mean to speak with boldness against
my people. I remember the words which my father hath spoken me,
and I do not write them in as plainness as I remember them.

Mosiah 1:4
 4 For I have none such thing as the Father, neither do I mean so
that I should speak as if I had any thing contrary to the
Gospel. I do not remember the things of my father at all.

Mosiah 1:5
 5 Behold, I have only these things which he hath written; yea, I do not
remember the things of my father.

Mosiah 1:6
 6 And now, my brethren, I do not remember the things of my father,
neither do ye. But behold, my soul delighteth in the things which my
father hath written; for behold, it is written in my father's
scripture; and behold, it is written plainly.

Mosiah 1:7
 7 And now, my brethren, I do not mean that ye ought to revile my
father, as if he were a madman; but I would show unto you that my
father saw him as he sat upon the throne in his majesty's
recess; and he was angry with him.

Mosiah 1:8
 8 And now, if my father had not been a king he would have
remembered the things of his fathers; and he would have put it
away, and he would have kept his commandments, and hearkened
unto the voice of the people; but behold, he did revile him,
and he said: Because thou hast said that my master should
be restoredin the redemption of my
fathers.

 7 And now, my brethren, I do not mean that ye ought to revile my
father, as if he were a madman; but I would show unto you that my
father saw him as he sat upon the throne in his majesty's
recess; and he was angry with him.

Mosiah 1:8
 8 And now, if my father had not been a king he would have
remembered the things of his fathers; and he would have put it
away, and he would have kept his commandments, and hearkened
unto the voice of the people; but behold, he did revile him,
and he said: Because thou hast said that my master should
be restored, behold, I will make thy horse neigh.

Mosiah 1:9
 9 And now, my brethren, I do not know but what my father hath
seen these things; and he is angry with my mother also; for
she is a witch, and she hath contrived many things
which are forbidden by the law.

Mosiah 1:10
 10 And it grieveth me that my mother should be a witch; for
I would that she should be a virgin, that she might not be
wicked, that she might not be initiated in the
service of men.

Mosiah 1:11
 11 But behold, she is a maiden; and it is not requisite that she
should be a virgin that men should know concerning her;
therefore, it matters not, for God will be merciful unto her,
that she may receive a remission of her sins.

Mosiah 1:12
 12 And it matters not if she receiveth a remission of her
sins; for God will be merciful unto her, and he will set her
right before his throne, that she may be made white in the
face of him, and his sons may see her; and also his daughters
may see her; and their beauty shall be known by them.

Mosiah 1:13
 13 Wherefore, if my father had not been a king he could have
remembered the law and the commandments of the Lord; but behold,
it matter not.

Mosiah 1:14
 14 Moreover, it matter not now if my father remember, and
remember the covenants of the Lord; for behold, it mattereth not
now whether he remember or not; for the Lord knoweth all
things, and all things are possible unto him.

Mosiah 1:15
 15 And behold, the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my
commandments ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch
as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my
presence.

Mosiah 1:16
 16 But behold, my beloved brethren, I have told you the truth as I have
taught it unto you; and the Lord knoweth your state; and he
knoweth that whosoever endureth to the end the same shall
be saved.

Mosiah 1:17
 17ld, I will make thy horse neigh.

Mosiah 1:9
 9 And now, my brethren, I do not know but what my father hath
seen these things; and he is angry with my mother also; for
she is a witch, and she hath contrived many things
which are forbidden by the law.

Mosiah 1:10
 10 And it grieveth me that my mother should be a witch; for
I would that she should be a virgin, that she might not be
wicked, that she might not be initiated in the
service of men.

Mosiah 1:11
 11 But behold, she is a maiden; and it is not requisite that she
should be a virgin that men should know concerning her;
therefore, it matters not, for God will be merciful unto her,
that she may receive a remission of her sins.

Mosiah 1:12
 12 And it matters not if she receiveth a remission of her
sins; for God will be merciful unto her, and he will set her
right before his throne, that she may be made white in the
face of him, and his sons may see her; and also his daughters
may see her; and their beauty shall be known by them.

Mosiah 1:13
 13 Wherefore, if my father had not been a king he could have
remembered the law and the commandments of the Lord; but behold,
it matter not.

Mosiah 1:14
 14 Moreover, it matter not now if my father remember, and
remember the covenants of the Lord; for behold, it mattereth not
now whether he remember or not; for the Lord knoweth all
things, and all things are possible unto him.

Mosiah 1:15
 15 And behold, the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my
commandments ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch
as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my
presence.

Mosiah 1:16
 16 But behold, my beloved brethren, I have told you the truth as I have
taught it unto you; and the Lord knoweth your state; and he
knoweth that whosoever endureth to the end the same shall
be saved.

Mosiah 1:17
 17 Nevertheless, the Lord knoweth that whosoever endureth to the
end the same shall be cut off from my presence.

Mosiah 1:18
 18 But behold, I have brought they down upon the earth; and I
hand them down unto you from one generation to another;
and I have not brought them down upon the earth but upon the
wind up unto yourselves, every one according to his generation.

Mosiah 1:19
 19 Wherefore, when my people shall have passed forth from one generation
to another, and shall have forgotten the things of my people, and
dwelt upon the sand of the sea, behold, it shall come to pass, that
they shall be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and only
they shall be gathered together at the right hand of the Lord.

Mosiah 1:20
 20 And they shall not be confounded with other people who have
passed away out of my womb; for they shall all be gathered together
at the right hand of the Lord.

Mosiah 1:21
 21 And they shall come to the knowledge of the Lord, and to
the knowledge of all that the Lord hath made known unto your
fathers in the wilderness.

Mosiah 1:22
 22 And now it came to pass after the Lord had made mention of
his word, his people began to be gathered together at the right
hand of the Lord.

Mosiah 1:23
 23 And it came to pass that they began to be great and
powerful; for they were no longer scattered abroad upon the face
of the earth, but they were again on the east, in the borders of
the land Bountiful.

Mosiah 1:24
 24 And, behold, also, they were in the borders by the east,
by the borders which were called Gilgal by the people who were in the
borders.

Mosiah 1:25
 25 And it came to pass that the people which were in the land
Bountiful, in the borders which had been peopled, began to
be gathered together.

Mosiah 1:26
 26 And the Lord spake unto Alma, saying: Behold, the people
of the land whom thou seest are gathered together.

Mosiah 1:27
 27 And now I speak unto you, Alma, and thou art the Lord
that knows all things.end the same shall be cut off from my presence.

Mosiah 1:18
 18 But behold, I have brought they down upon the earth; and I
hand them down unto you from one generation to another;
and I have not brought them down upon the earth but upon the
wind up unto yourselves, every one according to his generation.

Mosiah 1:19
 19 Wherefore, when my people shall have passed forth from one generation
to another, and shall have forgotten the things of my people, and
dwelt upon the sand of the sea, behold, it shall come to pass, that
they shall be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and only
they shall be gathered together at the right hand of the Lord.

Mosiah 1:20
 20 And they shall not be confounded with other people who have
passed away out of my womb; for they shall all be gathered together
at the right hand of the Lord.

Mosiah 1:21
 21 And they shall come to the knowledge of the Lord, and to
the knowledge of all that the Lord hath made known unto your
fathers in the wilderness.

Mosiah 1:22
 22 And now it came to pass after the Lord had made mention of
his word, his people began to be gathered together at the right
hand of the Lord.

Mosiah 1:23
 23 And it came to pass that they began to be great and
powerful; for they were no longer scattered abroad upon the face
of the earth, but they were again on the east, in the borders of
the land Bountiful.

Mosiah 1:24
 24 And, behold, also, they were in the borders by the east,
by the borders which were called Gilgal by the people who were in the
borders.

Mosiah 1:25
 25 And it came to pass that the people which were in the land
Bountiful, in the borders which had been peopled, began to
be gathered together.

Mosiah 1:26
 26 And the Lord spake unto Alma, saying: Behold, the people
of the land whom thou seest are gathered together.

Mosiah 1:27
 27 And now I speak unto you, Alma, and thou art the Lord
that knows all things.

Mosiah 1:28
 28 Behold, a word shall arise out of the dust; and it shall
speak unto the nations.

Mosiah 1:29
 29 Yea, and I speak unto you, Alma, and thou art the Lord that has
great words.

Mosiah 1:30
 30 Therefore, Alma, I speak unto you as though I spake from the
dead.

Mosiah 1:31
 31 Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from the
dead; for after this manner were the words of Alma.

Mosiah 1:32
 32 Yea, and I speak unto you, Alma, and thou art the Lord that hath
great words.

Mosiah 1:33
 33 And it shall come to pass in the days of Alma that the words
out of the mouth of Alma shall be translated into the hearts of the
people; and then shall the words which shall have come out of the mouth
of Alma be found among the people.

Mosiah 1:34
 34 And then shall the words which shall have come from the mouth of Alma
be heard by all the people, yea, even unto thousands.

Mosiah 1:35
 35 And then shall the words which have been spoken from the
death of Alma be translated into the hearts of the people; and then
shall the people have great words, which shall be translated into the
hearts of the people. And then shall the people have great words
translated into the hearts of the people; and then shall the
words which were translated into the hearts of the people be
found among the people; and then shall they know the true
meaning thereof.

Mosiah 1:36
 36 For Alma, he being a man of God, having authority from God, he
being a man of God was declared before God.

Mosiah 1:37
 37 For he had authority from God that he should preach unto the
people; for if he had power according to his words he should have power
over the people.

Mosiah 1:38
 38 And this is the meaning of Alma. He being a man of God, having
dwelt upon the sand of the sea, having been captured by the
people of the Lamanites, being a man of God, being called Alma, he being a
man of God, having authority from God that he should preach unto the
people, yea, a word shall arise out of the dust; and it shall
speak unto the nations.

Mosiah 1:29
 29 Yea, and I speak unto you, Alma, and thou art the Lord that has
great words.

Mosiah 1:30
 30 Therefore, Alma, I speak unto you as though I spake from the
dead.

Mosiah 1:31
 31 Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from the
dead; for after this manner were the words of Alma.

Mosiah 1:32
 32 Yea, and I speak unto you, Alma, and thou art the Lord that hath
great words.

Mosiah 1:33
 33 And it shall come to pass in the days of Alma that the words
out of the mouth of Alma shall be translated into the hearts of the
people; and then shall the words which shall have come out of the mouth
of Alma be found among the people.

Mosiah 1:34
 34 And then shall the words which shall have come from the mouth of Alma
be heard by all the people, yea, even unto thousands.

Mosiah 1:35
 35 And then shall the words which have been spoken from the
death of Alma be translated into the hearts of the people; and then
shall the people have great words, which shall be translated into the
hearts of the people. And then shall the people have great words
translated into the hearts of the people; and then shall the
words which were translated into the hearts of the people be
found among the people; and then shall they know the true
meaning thereof.

Mosiah 1:36
 36 For Alma, he being a man of God, having authority from God, he
being a man of God was declared before God.

Mosiah 1:37
 37 For he had authority from God that he should preach unto the
people; for if he had power according to his words he should have power
over the people.

Mosiah 1:38
 38 And this is the meaning of Alma. He being a man of God, having
dwelt upon the sand of the sea, having been captured by the
people of the Lamanites, being a man of God, being called Alma, he being a
man of God, having authority from God that he should preach unto the
people, yea, having authority that he should be received into the
Church of God, he being a man of God was declared before God.

Mosiah 1:39
 39 And now, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you, the
Lord is with thee; and he power is with thee, that thou
shalt live, and that thou shalt be governed by thy youth, and thy
widowhood, and thy children, according to the flesh;

Mosiah 1:40
 40 And also Alma, he being a man of God, having authority from
God that he should preach unto the people, yea, having authority
that he should be received into the Church of God, he being a man of God,
being called Alma, having authority from God that he should preach unto the
people, yea, having authority that he should be received in unto the
Church, he being a man of God was declared before God.

Mosiah 1:41
 41 And now, my beloved brethren, Alma having been a man of God, and
having authority that he should preach unto the people, having been
received into the Church by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was
given unto him by the Spirit of the voice of the Lord, notwithstanding
his being a man of God, yet he being a man of God, and having
the spirit of revelation and of justice, and the spirit of
prophecy and of baptism, therefore he being a man of God, and having
the spirit of revelation and of justice, and also being a prophet,
behold, he being a man of God and having all the commandments,
then he was a prophet also of the Lord, and he gave them unto us,
according to the spirit of prophecy and of revelation.

Mosiah 1:42
 42 Therefore, he being a prophet also of the Lord, behold, he
testified concerning us, and also concerning our records, which
were handed down by the prophets, even up to this day.

Mosiah 1:43
 43 And he testified that Alma, having been a man of God,
having been delivered out of the hands of the father of
him, who was an enemy to God, who was the father of all
manner of transgressions, yea, even murders, and all
manner of wickedness and abominations--

Mosiah 1:44
 44 Therefore, the Lord being angry with him,hurch of God, he being a man of God was declared before God.

Mosiah 1:39
 39 And now, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you, the
Lord is with thee; and he power is with thee, that thou
shalt live, and that thou shalt be governed by thy youth, and thy
widowhood, and thy children, according to the flesh;

Mosiah 1:40
 40 And also Alma, he being a man of God, having authority from
God that he should preach unto the people, yea, having authority
that he should be received into the Church of God, he being a man of God,
being called Alma, having authority from God that he should preach unto the
people, yea, having authority that he should be received in unto the
Church, he being a man of God was declared before God.

Mosiah 1:41
 41 And now, my beloved brethren, Alma having been a man of God, and
having authority that he should preach unto the people, having been
received into the Church by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was
given unto him by the Spirit of the voice of the Lord, notwithstanding
his being a man of God, yet he being a man of God, and having
the spirit of revelation and of justice, and the spirit of
prophecy and of baptism, therefore he being a man of God, and having
the spirit of revelation and of justice, and also being a prophet,
behold, he being a man of God and having all the commandments,
then he was a prophet also of the Lord, and he gave them unto us,
according to the spirit of prophecy and of revelation.

Mosiah 1:42
 42 Therefore, he being a prophet also of the Lord, behold, he
testified concerning us, and also concerning our records, which
were handed down by the prophets, even up to this day.

Mosiah 1:43
 43 And he testified that Alma, having been a man of God,
having been delivered out of the hands of the father of
him, who was an enemy to God, who was the father of all
manner of transgressions, yea, even murders, and all
manner of wickedness and abominations--

Mosiah 1:44
 44 Therefore, the Lord being angry with him, having
wrought upon him by his father, that he should be taken in
whom he had taken, being taken and preserved by mystery and
by fable; therefore, he being angry with him, having preserved
him, he desired also that he should bring forth the records
which he had hid up unto the children of men.

Mosiah 1:45
 45 And it came to pass that Alma did bring forth the
records, and also the interpreters, out of the
earth; and they were many.

Mosiah 1:46
 46 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: What
desirest thee? For behold, I will show unto thee the way
that thou wilt go.

Mosiah 1:47
 47 And Alma said unto them: I will show unto thee the way
that thou wilt go, for thou shalt have no other way.

Mosiah 1:48
 48 And it came to pass that when Alma had said these words,
they both halted.

Mosiah 1:49
 49 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: The way is
prepared that thou wilt have no other way; therefore, go, and tread
the earth with the sword, and die, and be cut off from the
presence of the Father.

Mosiah 1:50
 50 And Alma said unto them: I will not.

Mosiah 1:51
 51 And it came to pass that when Alma had said this, he
began to walk on the ground.

Mosiah 1:52
 52 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him: If thou wilt
wonder what I am, I will tell thee.

Mosiah 1:53
 53 And it came to pass that when he had said this, he
began to wonder.

Mosiah 1:54
 54 And he said unto him: Behold, I am he that have desired to be
called
man. Behold, I am he that have been brought unto you by the power of the
Gentiles; yea, and I am he that has been kept and preserved by
my revelations until now.

Mosiah 1:55
 55 And now, who is this that hath been kept and preserved? Behold, I
am the Messiah, the unspeakable Lamb, whom the Father hath
covenanted with my father, thatr of wickedness and abominations--

Mosiah 1:44
 44 Therefore, the Lord being angry with him, having
wrought upon him by his father, that he should be taken in
whom he had taken, being taken and preserved by mystery and
by fable; therefore, he being angry with him, having preserved
him, he desired also that he should bring forth the records
which he had hid up unto the children of men.

Mosiah 1:45
 45 And it came to pass that Alma did bring forth the
records, and also the interpreters, out of the
earth; and they were many.

Mosiah 1:46
 46 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: What
desirest thee? For behold, I will show unto thee the way
that thou wilt go.

Mosiah 1:47
 47 And Alma said unto them: I will show unto thee the way
that thou wilt go, for thou shalt have no other way.

Mosiah 1:48
 48 And it came to pass that when Alma had said these words,
they both halted.

Mosiah 1:49
 49 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: The way is
prepared that thou wilt have no other way; therefore, go, and tread
the earth with the sword, and die, and be cut off from the
presence of the Father.

Mosiah 1:50
 50 And Alma said unto them: I will not.

Mosiah 1:51
 51 And it came to pass that when Alma had said this, he
began to walk on the ground.

Mosiah 1:52
 52 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him: If thou wilt
wonder what I am, I will tell thee.

Mosiah 1:53
 53 And it came to pass that when he had said this, he
began to wonder.

Mosiah 1:54
 54 And he said unto him: Behold, I am he that have desired to be
called
man. Behold, I am he that have been brought unto you by the power of the
Gentiles; yea, and I am he that has been kept and preserved by
my revelations until now.

Mosiah 1:55
 55 And now, who is this that hath been kept and preserved? Behold, I
am the Messiah, the unspeakable Lamb, whom the Father hath
covenanted with my father, that he should be slain upon the cross of
the earth.

Mosiah 1:56
 56 And now, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that this is the
messiah whom the Father hath wrought. Behold, it was the Father that
hath spoken it unto you; therefore, the Father hath commanded me,
according to the spirit which I speak, to bring out of the
grave this man unto you.

Mosiah 1:57
 57 Now, whether he shall live or die I know not; but he shall be raised
to dwell at the right hand of the Father, among those who are
scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; and he shall be
wrought upon no longer until all things shall be made ready for
him, if it so be that he shall live.

Mosiah 1:58
 58 And behold, he shall not be wrought with jealousy; neither will he
be wrought with jealousy.

Mosiah 1:59
 59 When the day cometh that he shall be wrought in jealousy he
will return to the Father; but before that he shall return to the
Father he must first be wrought in jealousy.

Mosiah 1:60
 60 For behold, he was not wrought with jealousy, until the
Father wrought upon him, and he was returned to the Father.

Mosiah 2
Chapter 2

Mosiah 2:1
 1 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: Now the
Father hath commanded me that I should preach unto this people, after the
manner which thou hast taught them; and after that thou hast
performed this thou shalt be wrought in jealousy no more; and thou shalt
have no more desire to be wrought in jealousy.

Mosiah 2:2
 2 And now this is the commandment of the Father; and behold, I say
unto you, that if thou wilt remember to keep the
commandments of the Father thou shalt be lifted up at the last day
unto everlasting life.

Mosiah 2:3
 3 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto them:
Father, behold thou hast commanded me that I should
preach unto all this people.

Mosiah 2:4er hath
covenanted with my father, that he should be slain upon the cross of
the earth.

Mosiah 1:56
 56 And now, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that this is the
messiah whom the Father hath wrought. Behold, it was the Father that
hath spoken it unto you; therefore, the Father hath commanded me,
according to the spirit which I speak, to bring out of the
grave this man unto you.

Mosiah 1:57
 57 Now, whether he shall live or die I know not; but he shall be raised
to dwell at the right hand of the Father, among those who are
scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; and he shall be
wrought upon no longer until all things shall be made ready for
him, if it so be that he shall live.

Mosiah 1:58
 58 And behold, he shall not be wrought with jealousy; neither will he
be wrought with jealousy.

Mosiah 1:59
 59 When the day cometh that he shall be wrought in jealousy he
will return to the Father; but before that he shall return to the
Father he must first be wrought in jealousy.

Mosiah 1:60
 60 For behold, he was not wrought with jealousy, until the
Father wrought upon him, and he was returned to the Father.

Mosiah 2
Chapter 2

Mosiah 2:1
 1 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: Now the
Father hath commanded me that I should preach unto this people, after the
manner which thou hast taught them; and after that thou hast
performed this thou shalt be wrought in jealousy no more; and thou shalt
have no more desire to be wrought in jealousy.

Mosiah 2:2
 2 And now this is the commandment of the Father; and behold, I say
unto you, that if thou wilt remember to keep the
commandments of the Father thou shalt be lifted up at the last day
unto everlasting life.

Mosiah 2:3
 3 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto them:
Father, behold thou hast commanded me that I should
preach unto all this people.

Mosiah 2:4
 4 Behold thou art the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.
But Father, I say unto you, if thou wilt not remember to
keep the commandments of the Father thou shalt be lifted up at the
last day to eternal damnation.

Mosiah 2:5
 5 And now Alma said unto him: Believest thou that thou shalt
be lifted up at the last day?

Mosiah 2:6
 6 Believest thou that the devil hath power over thy soul?

Mosiah 2:7
 7 Believest thou that thou shalt be brought down to hell?

Mosiah 2:8
 8 Believest thou that I have authority over the heavens and the
governor of the earth?

Mosiah 2:9
 9 Believest thou that I have authority over mine own flesh?

Mosiah 2:10
 10 Believest thou that I have authority over mine own flesh?

Mosiah 2:11
 11 Believest thou that the time cometh, that thou shalt be as I am, and
ever after that thou shalt be brought down to the grave like unto me?

Mosiah 2:12
 12 Believest thou that the son of perdition shall be the first to rise;
and he shall be the last.

Mosiah 2:13
 13 And after he has risen from the dead he shall judge the nation;
and he shall make a distinction betwixt the righteous and the
sinful.

Mosiah 2:14
 14 For after all this, O house of Israel, thou shalt be as one of
them, ye that live and are, and are yet to come, and to
go a journey in the wilderness; and after thou hast been
recovered and sanctified by the Holy One of Israel thou shalt
be brought back again into the fold of the Holy One of
Israel.

Mosiah 2:15
 15 Wherefore, the Son of perdition, to fulfil his word which he has
spoken, shall be sought out, and shall be likened unto the fruit,
that it shall be likened unto the tree which is in the midst of the
woods.

Mosiah 2:16
 16 For behold, this day he hath spoken concerning the tree of
the which I have spoken--by him the tree shall be changed,
that it shall be good and become mighty fruit.

Mosiah 2:17
 17 But behold, the fruit, this day hee yesterday, to-day, and forever.
But Father, I say unto you, if thou wilt not remember to
keep the commandments of the Father thou shalt be lifted up at the
last day to eternal damnation.

Mosiah 2:5
 5 And now Alma said unto him: Believest thou that thou shalt
be lifted up at the last day?

Mosiah 2:6
 6 Believest thou that the devil hath power over thy soul?

Mosiah 2:7
 7 Believest thou that thou shalt be brought down to hell?

Mosiah 2:8
 8 Believest thou that I have authority over the heavens and the
governor of the earth?

Mosiah 2:9
 9 Believest thou that I have authority over mine own flesh?

Mosiah 2:10
 10 Believest thou that I have authority over mine own flesh?

Mosiah 2:11
 11 Believest thou that the time cometh, that thou shalt be as I am, and
ever after that thou shalt be brought down to the grave like unto me?

Mosiah 2:12
 12 Believest thou that the son of perdition shall be the first to rise;
and he shall be the last.

Mosiah 2:13
 13 And after he has risen from the dead he shall judge the nation;
and he shall make a distinction betwixt the righteous and the
sinful.

Mosiah 2:14
 14 For after all this, O house of Israel, thou shalt be as one of
them, ye that live and are, and are yet to come, and to
go a journey in the wilderness; and after thou hast been
recovered and sanctified by the Holy One of Israel thou shalt
be brought back again into the fold of the Holy One of
Israel.

Mosiah 2:15
 15 Wherefore, the Son of perdition, to fulfil his word which he has
spoken, shall be sought out, and shall be likened unto the fruit,
that it shall be likened unto the tree which is in the midst of the
woods.

Mosiah 2:16
 16 For behold, this day he hath spoken concerning the tree of
the which I have spoken--by him the tree shall be changed,
that it shall be good and become mighty fruit.

Mosiah 2:17
 17 But behold, the fruit, this day he saith, cometh of the
heavens, and the earth shall be rolled in the dust; and great
shall be the fruit, which shall be esteemed above all other fruit.

Mosiah 2:18
 18 And the Lord God shall say: I will not be likened unto the
fruit, neither will I be likened unto the worm that is upon the
face of the earth, neither shall I be likened unto the fire that is
wrought among the sons of men.

Mosiah 2:19
 19 And then shall the fire be kindled by the sons of men,
according to their desires and their anger, and their
rivers of fire shall be set aflame, the sons of men shall be
burned, and shall be as stubble.

Mosiah 2:20
 20 But the righteous shall return unto the tree of the
father of fire, and the Lord of the earth shall rend it up;
the house of Israel shall not crush them, neither shall the house of
Israel rend it up.

Mosiah 2:21
 21 Wherefore a remnant of the righteous shall be scattered upon the face
of the earth; and the Lord of the earth shall rend it up, and the house of
Israel shall not crush it, neither shall they rend it up.

Mosiah 2:22
 22 And there shall come forth a catch, and there shall go forth a prey;
for the Lord of Hosts shall roar, and the Lord of the earth shall shake, and
the inhabitants of the whole earth shall return to their lands.

Mosiah 2:23
 23 Behold, the Lord of Hosts and the Lord of the Earth shall not be
stoned.

Mosiah 2:24
 24 For the Lord of Hosts and the Lord of the Earth shall be
stoned, and all flesh shall be hid, and shall be as darkness.

Mosiah 2:25
 25 And they that dwell in the midst shall be lifted up at the last
day, and shall be brought down to stand before the bar of the
judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel.

Mosiah 2:26
 26 And then shall the heavens of heaven be opened, and all
things shall be revealed to them who are of the house
of Israel.

Mosiah, the fruit, this day he saith, cometh of the
heavens, and the earth shall be rolled in the dust; and great
shall be the fruit, which shall be esteemed above all other fruit.

Mosiah 2:18
 18 And the Lord God shall say: I will not be likened unto the
fruit, neither will I be likened unto the worm that is upon the
face of the earth, neither shall I be likened unto the fire that is
wrought among the sons of men.

Mosiah 2:19
 19 And then shall the fire be kindled by the sons of men,
according to their desires and their anger, and their
rivers of fire shall be set aflame, the sons of men shall be
burned, and shall be as stubble.

Mosiah 2:20
 20 But the righteous shall return unto the tree of the
father of fire, and the Lord of the earth shall rend it up;
the house of Israel shall not crush them, neither shall the house of
Israel rend it up.

Mosiah 2:21
 21 Wherefore a remnant of the righteous shall be scattered upon the face
of the earth; and the Lord of the earth shall rend it up, and the house of
Israel shall not crush it, neither shall they rend it up.

Mosiah 2:22
 22 And there shall come forth a catch, and there shall go forth a prey;
for the Lord of Hosts shall roar, and the Lord of the earth shall shake, and
the inhabitants of the whole earth shall return to their lands.

Mosiah 2:23
 23 Behold, the Lord of Hosts and the Lord of the Earth shall not be
stoned.

Mosiah 2:24
 24 For the Lord of Hosts and the Lord of the Earth shall be
stoned, and all flesh shall be hid, and shall be as darkness.

Mosiah 2:25
 25 And they that dwell in the midst shall be lifted up at the last
day, and shall be brought down to stand before the bar of the
judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel.

Mosiah 2:26
 26 And then shall the heavens of heaven be opened, and all
things shall be revealed to them who are of the house
of Israel.

Mosiah 2:27
 27 Therefore remember the words of the king of the people of
Nephi, saying: I saw my people with exceeding sorrow,
because of the wickedness and abomination of their
fathers.

Mosiah 2:28
 28 Yea, remember that I said: They that dwell in the
midst of the earth shall be lifted up at the last day, and
all flesh shall be hid.

Mosiah 2:29
 29 For behold, I am he that hideth the riches of my
people; they are hid away in the earth, and I am they
who hide them away in the earth.

Mosiah 2:30
 30 Wo unto them; for thus saith the Lord in the beginning,
I will show unto them that which shall be done among them,
at the last day; and that which shall be done among them at
the last day shall be repentance and faith on the Lord of
Hosts.

Mosiah 2:31
 31 And the Lord said with a loud voice: Repent ye, repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand.

Mosiah 2:32
 32 And he that endureth to the end the same shall be
reserved, both for himself and his children.

Mosiah 2:33
 33 And it shall come to pass in that day that all flesh shall
be numbered among my people, and shall be brought forth out of
the earth; and they shall no more be found unclean than clean.

Mosiah 2:34
 34 And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord, that whoso among my
people shall call on the name of the Lord, the Lord shall
he remember, and be saved.

Mosiah 2:35
 35 Therefore, O house of Israel, do not be ashamed; for thy priests
shall see thee as burning coals do not harm, and thy
innumerable house shall be made small.

Mosiah 2:36
 36 And remember, the Lord hath said: Repent ye, repent, for
of all ye, for the kingdom of all your sins.

Mosiah 2:37
 37 Yea, repent, for the sins, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand.

Mosiah 2:38
 38 Yea, sayeth the Lord, and openeth the heavens, and
bindeth down the earth, and bringeth forthsrael.

Mosiah 2:27
 27 Therefore remember the words of the king of the people of
Nephi, saying: I saw my people with exceeding sorrow,
because of the wickedness and abomination of their
fathers.

Mosiah 2:28
 28 Yea, remember that I said: They that dwell in the
midst of the earth shall be lifted up at the last day, and
all flesh shall be hid.

Mosiah 2:29
 29 For behold, I am he that hideth the riches of my
people; they are hid away in the earth, and I am they
who hide them away in the earth.

Mosiah 2:30
 30 Wo unto them; for thus saith the Lord in the beginning,
I will show unto them that which shall be done among them,
at the last day; and that which shall be done among them at
the last day shall be repentance and faith on the Lord of
Hosts.

Mosiah 2:31
 31 And the Lord said with a loud voice: Repent ye, repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand.

Mosiah 2:32
 32 And he that endureth to the end the same shall be
reserved, both for himself and his children.

Mosiah 2:33
 33 And it shall come to pass in that day that all flesh shall
be numbered among my people, and shall be brought forth out of
the earth; and they shall no more be found unclean than clean.

Mosiah 2:34
 34 And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord, that whoso among my
people shall call on the name of the Lord, the Lord shall
he remember, and be saved.

Mosiah 2:35
 35 Therefore, O house of Israel, do not be ashamed; for thy priests
shall see thee as burning coals do not harm, and thy
innumerable house shall be made small.

Mosiah 2:36
 36 And remember, the Lord hath said: Repent ye, repent, for
of all ye, for the kingdom of all your sins.

Mosiah 2:37
 37 Yea, repent, for the sins, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand.

Mosiah 2:38
 38 Yea, sayeth the Lord, and openeth the heavens, and
bindeth down the earth, and bringeth forth by signs and by
my rock and by wonders the fruit of your loins.

Mosiah 2:39
 39 And it shall come to pass that when they shall say,
Repent ye, the heavens shall shut their fold; and they
shall no more be numbered among my people.

Mosiah 2:40
 40 And again, it shall come to pass when they shall say
no more, the heavens shall open; and they shall be numbered
among my people, and shall be brought forth by signs and
by wonders of the fruit of thy loins.

Mosiah 2:41
 41 And it shall come to pass that when they shall be brought
forth by signs and by wonders, thou shalt no more be ashamed,
but thou shalt be blessed.

Mosiah 2:42
 42 But, behold, the rod of thy loins which is long, which
thrusteth away the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters, which
are thy sons and thy daughters--

Mosiah 2:43
 43 Thou shalt be cut off from among my people, even as the
rod of the loins of my people, which is broken and dried up,
shall be before the son of my people.

Mosiah 2:44
 44 And I, the Lord, will make thy enemies exceedingly
sorrowful; and thou shalt be afflicted, and thy ways of
walking shall be as a desolate wilderness.

Mosiah 2:45
 45 Behold, I am he who made thee sick, O house of Israel.
I am he that made thee lame; I am he that stretched forth
my hand upon thee a hundredfold and made thee three ways,
according to the movements of the body. I am he that did
it.

Mosiah 2:46
 46 I am he who laid the foundation of the earth, and stretched
it forth as a garment; I am he that caused the waters to
bring forth a great harvest, and they shall be gathered in
the end. I am he that curbed the wings of the eagle,
that he shall no more roar; but he shall remain as a
ghost, and shall be a shadow of darkness; but the powers of
him which are in the heavens shall be forever and ever.

Mosiah 2:47
 47 And it shallgeth forth by signs and by
my rock and by wonders the fruit of your loins.

Mosiah 2:39
 39 And it shall come to pass that when they shall say,
Repent ye, the heavens shall shut their fold; and they
shall no more be numbered among my people.

Mosiah 2:40
 40 And again, it shall come to pass when they shall say
no more, the heavens shall open; and they shall be numbered
among my people, and shall be brought forth by signs and
by wonders of the fruit of thy loins.

Mosiah 2:41
 41 And it shall come to pass that when they shall be brought
forth by signs and by wonders, thou shalt no more be ashamed,
but thou shalt be blessed.

Mosiah 2:42
 42 But, behold, the rod of thy loins which is long, which
thrusteth away the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters, which
are thy sons and thy daughters--

Mosiah 2:43
 43 Thou shalt be cut off from among my people, even as the
rod of the loins of my people, which is broken and dried up,
shall be before the son of my people.

Mosiah 2:44
 44 And I, the Lord, will make thy enemies exceedingly
sorrowful; and thou shalt be afflicted, and thy ways of
walking shall be as a desolate wilderness.

Mosiah 2:45
 45 Behold, I am he who made thee sick, O house of Israel.
I am he that made thee lame; I am he that stretched forth
my hand upon thee a hundredfold and made thee three ways,
according to the movements of the body. I am he that did
it.

Mosiah 2:46
 46 I am he who laid the foundation of the earth, and stretched
it forth as a garment; I am he that caused the waters to
bring forth a great harvest, and they shall be gathered in
the end. I am he that curbed the wings of the eagle,
that he shall no more roar; but he shall remain as a
ghost, and shall be a shadow of darkness; but the powers of
him which are in the heavens shall be forever and ever.

Mosiah 2:47
 47 And it shall come to pass in that day that all the
children of men shall see the angels of him who hath
interpreted the language of the nations;

Mosiah 2:48
 48 And they shall know that he hath no respect for the
children who are with child; for all this his aim is
to destroy them, that he may have everlasting life.

Mosiah 2:49
 49 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. I am he whom the
Lord hath led away out of the womb, and hath kept
departed from thence. Behold, I am he whom the Lord hath
raised up from the dead.

Mosiah 2:50
 50 And now I declare, that all these things are true; for
I saw them, and they are true.

Mosiah 2:51
 51 Behold, these things which thou hast read are necessary to
concerning the things of my people, and also the things
of my children.

Mosiah 2:52
 52 And now it shall come to pass, that in that day that all
these things shall be made known to the children of men
that they may be judged of their parents according to
their activity in childhood.

Mosiah 2:53
 53 And now I speak of the things which thou hast read, that
thy heart may be filled with gladness, and thy whole
heart with joy; for that which thou hast read, that thou mayest
finally have knowledge of the things of thy fathers--that thou mayest
know that this is the case, that thou beheldest the things
concerning them before they were written.

Mosiah 2:54
 54 And now I speak concerning the things which thou hast read, which
are not written, thou hast not remembered.

Mosiah 2:55
 55 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto thee, which thou hast not
remembered.

Mosiah 2:56
 56 And I will speak plainly unto thee, which thou hast not
remembered.

Chapter 3

Mosiah 3:1
 1 And now I speak unto you, whether ye shall believe in the
manner of these things which thou hast read, or in the
manner of the things of my Father which I have taught thee,
behold, I say unto you, as I have testified before thee, he hath
observed and he has taught me.

all see the angels of him who hath
interpreted the language of the nations;

children who are with child; for all this his aim is
to destroy them, that he may have everlasting life.

Mosiah 2:49
 49 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. I am he whom the
Lord hath led away out of the womb, and hath kept

3 Nephi 3:2
 2 And as the Father hath given me commandment that I should bring these things
forth unto the world, even so let it be unto the children of men,
to bring them forth unto the children of God.

Mosiah 3:3
 3 And behold, I say unto you that the things of my Father
which shall be made known unto the children of men hereafter
shall be given unto them in plainness, even to all mankind.

Mosiah 3:4
 4 For behold, the Lord hath given the spirit of every man that he
should cry unto all the children of men; therefore all the
children of men shall know concerning the things of my Father which
are of my Father.

Mosiah 3:5
 5 And now I speak concerning the things which thou hast read.
Thou hast read that the spirit of the Lord hath been
obtained of the children of men; therefore I speak unto you,
concerning his Spirit.

Mosiah 3:6
 6 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that thou shouldst suppose that
many have seen my Father, before they were even baptized in the
water of Mormon. Thou hast supposed that all this hath been done
by the power of the Spirit.

Mosiah 3:7
 7 But behold, I say unto you, that the Lord hath not rested his hand upon
the children of men; but it hath been done by the power of the
Spirit, and it hath been of God, and it has been according to his
word.

Mosiah 3:8
 8 For behold, the Lord hath said that: If ye will hearken unto
the words of this child, then shall thy seed be blessed in
the kingdom of God.

Mosiah 3:9
 9 And now, I would that ye should know, that as many as had been holy
children of God, even unto the end of their days, were also
baptized in the water of Mormon; and the Holy Ghost was given
unto them by the power of the water.

Mosiah 3:10
 10 And now, because of this power and the gift of the Holy
Ghost, and the gift of the Holy One of Israel, unto the
preserving of their bodies in the immortal state, they
have been brought back from mortality and have had a
perfectlye Father hath given me commandment that I should bring these things
forth unto the world, even so let it be unto the children of men,
to bring them forth unto the children of God.

Mosiah 3:3
 3 And behold, I say unto you that the things of my Father
which shall be made known unto the children of men hereafter
shall be given unto them in plainness, even to all mankind.

Mosiah 3:4
 4 For behold, the Lord hath given the spirit of every man that he
should cry unto all the children of men; therefore all the
children of men shall know concerning the things of my Father which
are of my Father.

Mosiah 3:5
 5 And now I speak concerning the things which thou hast read.
Thou hast read that the spirit of the Lord hath been
obtained of the children of men; therefore I speak unto you,
concerning his Spirit.

Mosiah 3:6
 6 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that thou shouldst suppose that
many have seen my Father, before they were even baptized in the
water of Mormon. Thou hast supposed that all this hath been done
by the power of the Spirit.

Mosiah 3:7
 7 But behold, I say unto you, that the Lord hath not rested his hand upon
the children of men; but it hath been done by the power of the
Spirit, and it hath been of God, and it has been according to his
word.

Mosiah 3:8
 8 For behold, the Lord hath said that: If ye will hearken unto
the words of this child, then shall thy seed be blessed in
the kingdom of God.

Mosiah 3:9
 9 And now, I would that ye should know, that as many as had been holy
children of God, even unto the end of their days, were also
baptized in the water of Mormon; and the Holy Ghost was given
unto them by the power of the water.

Mosiah 3:10
 10 And now, because of this power and the gift of the Holy
Ghost, and the gift of the Holy One of Israel, unto the
preserving of their bodies in the immortal state, they
have been brought back from mortality and have had a
perfectly spiritual body, the like of which hath never been
prepared among all the earth; therefore they are immortal, and
everlastingly they are brought back from mortality.

Mosiah 3:11
 11 And now, because of the many blessings which they have had
upon the face of the earth, and this because of the gift of
the Holy One of Israel, they are not come down out of the
dead, but await to inherit the kingdom of God.

Mosiah 3:12
 12 And now, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you, that if ye
are not brought back from mortality, ye shall be brought down
into the dead; and if ye are brought down into the dead, the
GOD will be merciful unto you.

Mosiah 3:13
 13 And now, my beloved brethren, I have spoken plainly unto
you; but if ye have not read it, heere hath the Holy One of
Israel commanded me that I should say: Repent ye, repent ye.

Mosiah 3:14
 14 Therefore, go, and at the last day, when ye shall be
brought forth from the dead, and shall behold the Son of the
Eternal Father, then will I spare you. Amen.

Mosiah 3:15
 15 And now I speak concerning the resurrection of the dead.
Behold, I have told you that there are two ways that man can be
reborn of God, and this is by man's own accord, and not by
the operation of the power of the resurrection of the dead,
which bringeth about the resurrection of the dead, repentance
of all mankind.

Mosiah 3:16
 16 But behold, I tell you that there are three ways that man can be
born of God, and this is by the resurrection of the dead,
which bringeth about the resurrection of the dead, and
also the redemption of all mankind.

Mosiah 3:17
 17 These are they that are overcome, and they are made whole,
that thereby come forth, even the dead, and behold the Son of
the Eternal Father.

Mosiah 3:18
 18 And now, this is not all; but this is only the first resurrection.

Mosiah 3:19
 19 And again, this is not all; but this is only the first resurrection;
but there shall be signs given in heaven, even unto thy
conversion.

Mosiahhich hath never been
prepared among all the earth; therefore they are immortal, and
everlastingly they are brought back from mortality.

Mosiah 3:11
 11 And now, because of the many blessings which they have had
upon the face of the earth, and this because of the gift of
the Holy One of Israel, they are not come down out of the
dead, but await to inherit the kingdom of God.

Mosiah 3:12
 12 And now, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you, that if ye
are not brought back from mortality, ye shall be brought down
into the dead; and if ye are brought down into the dead, the
GOD will be merciful unto you.

Mosiah 3:13
 13 And now, my beloved brethren, I have spoken plainly unto
you; but if ye have not read it, heere hath the Holy One of
Israel commanded me that I should say: Repent ye, repent ye.

Mosiah 3:14
 14 Therefore, go, and at the last day, when ye shall be
brought forth from the dead, and shall behold the Son of the
Eternal Father, then will I spare you. Amen.

Mosiah 3:15
 15 And now I speak concerning the resurrection of the dead.
Behold, I have told you that there are two ways that man can be
reborn of God, and this is by man's own accord, and not by
the operation of the power of the resurrection of the dead,
which bringeth about the resurrection of the dead, repentance
of all mankind.

Mosiah 3:16
 16 But behold, I tell you that there are three ways that man can be
born of God, and this is by the resurrection of the dead,
which bringeth about the resurrection of the dead, and
also the redemption of all mankind.

Mosiah 3:17
 17 These are they that are overcome, and they are made whole,
that thereby come forth, even the dead, and behold the Son of
the Eternal Father.

Mosiah 3:18
 18 And now, this is not all; but this is only the first resurrection.

Mosiah 3:19
 19 And again, this is not all; but this is only the first resurrection;
but there shall be signs given in heaven, even unto thy
conversion.

Mosiah 3:20
 20 But behold, these signs and tokens of thy conversion shall
not all be given in one body; but there shall be signs given of thy
conversion, even unto destruction; for so great shall be the
destruction of all flesh that endureth to the end.

Mosiah 3:21
 21 And again, there shall be signs given of thy death; for the
word of the Lord shall be fulfilled, which he saith: My sheep
shall hear my voice, they of the household of my
affection.

Mosiah 3:22
 22 And there shall be signs given of thy death, even unto destruction
of Thy people, even unto the utter destruction of the blood of thy
people.

Mosiah 3:23
 23 For thus saith the Lord: I will raise up a lamb, and
lay it for a sacrifice for the sins of thy people.

Mosiah 3:24
 24 And I will give up the name of the Lord of Hosts, that the
Lord of Hosts may be exalted in the Lord; and I will give up the
name of the Lord of Hosts, that the Lord of Hosts may be
escaped from off the face of the earth.

Mosiah 3:25
 25 For the Lord of Hosts is taken away, and the Lord of
Hosts shall be His name. And the Lord of Hosts shall be His
name.

Mosiah 3:26
 26 For the Lord of Hosts shall be the name of the Lord of Hosts,
in the which shall be an everlasting destruction; and
the Lord of Hosts shall be His name.

Mosiah 3:27
 27 And again, the Lord of Hosts shall be his name. For he
of whom I said, I will raise up a lamb; then I will
lay it for a sacrifice; and I will make a new creature; for
the things whereof shall he recover.

Mosiah 3:28
 28 For the Lord of Hosts is taken away, and the Lord
of Hosts shall be his name; for he shall be likened unto
flesh, and shall be despised, and shall be put out from among
the Gentiles.

Mosiah 3:29
 29 For the Lord of Hosts shall be the Lord of Hosts, and
the Lordesurrection;
but there shall be signs given in heaven, even unto thy
conversion.

Mosiah 3:20
 20 But behold, these signs and tokens of thy conversion shall
not all be given in one body; but there shall be signs given of thy
conversion, even unto destruction; for so great shall be the
destruction of all flesh that endureth to the end.

Mosiah 3:21
 21 And again, there shall be signs given of thy death; for the
word of the Lord shall be fulfilled, which he saith: My sheep
shall hear my voice, they of the household of my
affection.

Mosiah 3:22
 22 And there shall be signs given of thy death, even unto destruction
of Thy people, even unto the utter destruction of the blood of thy
people.

Mosiah 3:23
 23 For thus saith the Lord: I will raise up a lamb, and
lay it for a sacrifice for the sins of thy people.

Mosiah 3:24
 24 And I will give up the name of the Lord of Hosts, that the
Lord of Hosts may be exalted in the Lord; and I will give up the
name of the Lord of Hosts, that the Lord of Hosts may be
escaped from off the face of the earth.

Mosiah 3:25
 25 For the Lord of Hosts is taken away, and the Lord of
Hosts shall be His name. And the Lord of Hosts shall be His
name.

Mosiah 3:26
 26 For the Lord of Hosts shall be the name of the Lord of Hosts,
in the which shall be an everlasting destruction; and
the Lord of Hosts shall be His name.

Mosiah 3:27
 27 And again, the Lord of Hosts shall be his name. For he
of whom I said, I will raise up a lamb; then I will
lay it for a sacrifice; and I will make a new creature; for
the things whereof shall he recover.

Mosiah 3:28
 28 For the Lord of Hosts is taken away, and the Lord
of Hosts shall be his name; for he shall be likened unto
flesh, and shall be despised, and shall be put out from among
the Gentiles.

Mosiah 3:29
 29 For the Lord of Hosts shall be the Lord of Hosts, and
the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in the Lord; for he of
hosts shall be for milk, and for drink; and he shall he
comfort over the brokenhearted.

Mosiah 3:30
 30 For the Lord of Hosts shall be a wolf, and the Lord
of Hosts shall be a lamb, and the Lord of Hosts shall
receive him comfort.

Mosiah 3:31
 31 For the wolf also shall grow up, and also the lamb;
and they shall stand before the judge, and shall be judged
according to their own works.

Mosiah 3:32
 32 But the Lamb of God shall wither before the dogs, and
the Holy One of Hosts shall low down the mountains, and
shall be humbled.

Mosiah 3:33
 33 Cry unto the Lord, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, and let
elements wax conflagrant, that the fire of his fury
doth not consume all flesh; neither at his rebuke, nor at
the rebuke of his anger, can any man be angry.

Mosiah 3:34

food in the midst of strangers; they shall learn by your
light.

comfort over the brokenhearted.

 30 For the Lord of Hosts shall be a wolf, and the Lord
of Hosts shall be a lamb, and the Lord of Hosts shall
receive him comfort.

Mosiah 3:31
 31 For the wolf also shall grow up, and also the lamb;
and they shall stand before the judge, and shall be judged
according to their own works.

Mosiah 3:32
 32 But the Lamb of God shall wither before the dogs, and
the Holy One of Hosts shall low down the mountains, and
shall be humbled.

Mosiah 3:33
 33 Cry unto the Lord, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, and let
elements wax conflagrant, that the fire of his fury
doth not consume all flesh; neither at his rebuke, nor at
the rebuke of his anger, can any man be angry.

Mosiah 3:34
 34 Behold, the Lord of Hosts is slain; and the Lord of
Hosts is afflicted.

shall be devoured; and the prey shall be of the hollow tree.

receive my words.

he shall feel no more the chill of winter.

Mosiah 3:52
 52 The child shall read to him the words of the father,
saying:

THE BOOK OF MORONI

Moroni 1
Chapter 1

Moroni 1:1
 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of my migration into the
wilderness. My fathers having been greatly astonished at the
word of the Lord which I did write, that my fathers supposed
that I was writing upon plates; nevertheless, I have
beheld that they are vain; for I have seen them; and they
have enlarged by many things which I have written.

Moroni 1:2
 2 Behold, I have written the records of my fathers; and I have
performed many things which I have written in the land of
My father.

Moroni 1:3
 3 Behold, I know the scriptures which have been handed
down by me. Behold, I know the words of the Holy One
of Israel; and I pray him continually that he may bless you,
that his blessings may rest upon you, and that he will not suffer
that ye perish.

Moroni 1:4
 4 O then, after this manner of language did my father speak.

Moroni 1:5
 5 My father hath made known unto me the covenants which he
had made unto the Lord concerning the land of Jerusalem;
yea, after the record which my father hath made
public, after the record which my father hath made also
publiceth, after the record which my father hath made
also publiceth--

Moroni 1:6
 6 And I pray that the Lord will bless this land unto thy
rejoice; yea, that hereafter thou shalt be blessed in the land.

Moroni 1:7
 7 And my father hath made all these things known unto me; yea, he
hath made known unto me the covenants which he hath made unto
the Lord; and also all the words of the Holy One which he spake
unto all the people, even unto many of our fathers.

Moroni 1:8
 8 Behold, my father hath made these things known unto me, after the
manner of the king of the peoples which were upon the northward.

Moroni 1:9
 9 Behold, my father hath made these things known unto me, that I might
know, that I say unto you that there are no other records in all the
wilderness, save it be the record of the two kings who were
the children of Noah, who deposited their dead and
their sacred things, including the two niches, by the side
of the waters of the Red Sea, in the place of the great
drowned city.

Moroni 1:10
 10 But this is the account which my father hath given me; and
he that studyeth diligently, the same is called a wise man, and
a prudent man also.

Moroni 1:11
 11 And now, my brethren, I say unto you, that the things of
this day are not known unto me; yea, they are hid, and they
are called things ofer.

Moroni 1:3
 3 Behold, I know the scriptures which have been handed
down by me. Behold, I know the words of the Holy One
of Israel; and I pray him continually that he may bless you,
that his blessings may rest upon you, and that he will not suffer
that ye perish.

Moroni 1:4
 4 O then, after this manner of language did my father speak.

Moroni 1:5
 5 My father hath made known unto me the covenants which he
had made unto the Lord concerning the land of Jerusalem;
yea, after the record which my father hath made
public, after the record which my father hath made also
publiceth, after the record which my father hath made
also publiceth--

Moroni 1:6
 6 And I pray that the Lord will bless this land unto thy
rejoice; yea, that hereafter thou shalt be blessed in the land.

Moroni 1:7
 7 And my father hath made all these things known unto me; yea, he
hath made known unto me the covenants which he hath made unto
the Lord; and also all the words of the Holy One which he spake
unto all the people, even unto many of our fathers.

Moroni 1:8
 8 Behold, my father hath made these things known unto me, after the
manner of the king of the peoples which were upon the northward.

Moroni 1:9
 9 Behold, my father hath made these things known unto me, that I might
know, that I say unto you that there are no other records in all the
wilderness, save it be the record of the two kings who were
the children of Noah, who deposited their dead and
their sacred things, including the two niches, by the side
of the waters of the Red Sea, in the place of the great
drowned city.

Moroni 1:10
 10 But this is the account which my father hath given me; and
he that studyeth diligently, the same is called a wise man, and
a prudent man also.

Moroni 1:11
 11 And now, my brethren, I say unto you, that the things of
this day are not known unto me; yea, they are hid, and they
are called things of God, which are unto the child of men.

Moroni 1:12
 12 Therefore, my beloved brethren, my father hath commanded
me that I should write the records which he hath made
known unto me; and this I do because of the things which
are called of God.

Moroni 1:13
 13 And I do this because the scope thereof is to be enlarged,
and the mind thereof is directed towards that which is
pertaining to the children of men.

Moroni 1:14
 14 Behold, I have written the records which my father hath
written; and I do not write the records which come from the
mouths of the prophets, which are not of this world.

Moroni 1:15
 15 Behold, I have not written the records of my father, which
were engraven upon the plates of brass; neither have I written
the records which are engraven upon the plates of Nephi.

Moroni 1:16
 16 Behold, there are records which have been kept back by the
children of men.

Moroni 1:17
 17 And these are they which have been kept back by the children of
men; for they are engraven upon plates which are of old, and have
been delivered up unto the children of men by the might of God.

Moroni 1:18
 18 And these plates were delivered up unto the children of men,
that they might be kept back by the children of men, that they
might be kept from the opening of the records which have been
kept back from the children of men.

Moroni 1:19
 19 And behold, they have been kept back that the father of them
could not find them, that he might not learn concerning the sons of
Ammon, which were desirous to come and partake of the
fruit of the land; for behold, they had been kept back by the
father of them, that he could not learn the things which had been
commanded of the Lord; therefore he was desirous that he might
learn concerning them.

Moroni 1:20
 20 But behold, the Spirit of the Lord had withdrawn from
them, and they had hid up their records and their holy
stones from the Lord, that they could not be brought forth and
brought forth unto the knowledge of the children of
men.

Moroni Therefore, my beloved brethren, my father hath commanded
me that I should write the records which he hath made
known unto me; and this I do because of the things which
are called of God.

Moroni 1:13
 13 And I do this because the scope thereof is to be enlarged,
and the mind thereof is directed towards that which is
pertaining to the children of men.

Moroni 1:14
 14 Behold, I have written the records which my father hath
written; and I do not write the records which come from the
mouths of the prophets, which are not of this world.

Moroni 1:15
 15 Behold, I have not written the records of my father, which
were engraven upon the plates of brass; neither have I written
the records which are engraven upon the plates of Nephi.

Moroni 1:16
 16 Behold, there are records which have been kept back by the
children of men.

Moroni 1:17
 17 And these are they which have been kept back by the children of
men; for they are engraven upon plates which are of old, and have
been delivered up unto the children of men by the might of God.

Moroni 1:18
 18 And these plates were delivered up unto the children of men,
that they might be kept back by the children of men, that they
might be kept from the opening of the records which have been
kept back from the children of men.

Moroni 1:19
 19 And behold, they have been kept back that the father of them
could not find them, that he might not learn concerning the sons of
Ammon, which were desirous to come and partake of the
fruit of the land; for behold, they had been kept back by the
father of them, that he could not learn the things which had been
commanded of the Lord; therefore he was desirous that he might
learn concerning them.

Moroni 1:20
 20 But behold, the Spirit of the Lord had withdrawn from
them, and they had hid up their records and their holy
stones from the Lord, that they could not be brought forth and
brought forth unto the knowledge of the children of
men.

Moroni 1:21
 21 Therefore, the son of Ammon, being so desirous to learn of
the children of men, he from that time forth did diligently seek
them.

Moroni 1:22
 22 And it came to pass that he did remember the commandments of
the Lord, and his fathers; therefore, he began to write the
records which were kept back by the children of men.

Moroni 1:23
 23 And it came to pass that he began to write the records
which were kept back by the children of men.

Moroni 1:24
 24 And it came to pass that he began to write the records
which were kept back by the children of men, even until his
earths had been exhausted.

Moroni 1:25
 25 And it came to pass that he did finish the record which he
had begun to write; and he did write the record which had
been kept back by the children of men.

Moroni 1:26
 26 And he did write the record which had been kept
back by the children of men; and he did write the record which
had been kept back by the children of men; and he did write
the record which had been kept back by the children of
men.

Moroni 1:27
 27 And it came to pass that he did write the names of the
people who had been killed by the hand of the Lord;

Moroni 1:28
 28 And when he had finished writing the names he did write the
remembrance of the people, that they should not be destroyed;
for he being of the church, he was bound by the law that he
should not kill.

Moroni 1:29
 29 And it came to pass that he did remember the covenant which
his fathers had made; therefore, he did write the names of the
concubines who were engaged in the whoredoms of their
wives, that the children of men might know that their women
were conductors, that they must be destroyed if they should give suck.

Moroni 1:30
 30 And this he did because of the great evil which would come upon the
children of men, according to the words of the prophets.

Moroni 1:31
 31 Therefore Moroni did make a record of the things which he had
eschewed down; yea, even he did find the bones of the man that
was laid upon the earth, that he Ammon, being so desirous to learn of
the children of men, he from that time forth did diligently seek
them.

Moroni 1:22
 22 And it came to pass that he did remember the commandments of
the Lord, and his fathers; therefore, he began to write the
records which were kept back by the children of men.

Moroni 1:23
 23 And it came to pass that he began to write the records
which were kept back by the children of men.

Moroni 1:24
 24 And it came to pass that he began to write the records
which were kept back by the children of men, even until his
earths had been exhausted.

Moroni 1:25
 25 And it came to pass that he did finish the record which he
had begun to write; and he did write the record which had
been kept back by the children of men.

Moroni 1:26
 26 And he did write the record which had been kept
back by the children of men; and he did write the record which
had been kept back by the children of men; and he did write
the record which had been kept back by the children of
men.

Moroni 1:27
 27 And it came to pass that he did write the names of the
people who had been killed by the hand of the Lord;

Moroni 1:28
 28 And when he had finished writing the names he did write the
remembrance of the people, that they should not be destroyed;
for he being of the church, he was bound by the law that he
should not kill.

Moroni 1:29
 29 And it came to pass that he did remember the covenant which
his fathers had made; therefore, he did write the names of the
concubines who were engaged in the whoredoms of their
wives, that the children of men might know that their women
were conductors, that they must be destroyed if they should give suck.

Moroni 1:30
 30 And this he did because of the great evil which would come upon the
children of men, according to the words of the prophets.

Moroni 1:31
 31 Therefore Moroni did make a record of the things which he had
eschewed down; yea, even he did find the bones of the man that
was laid upon the earth, that he might obtain the bones which
had been laid upon the earth.

Moroni 1:32
 32 And he did make a record of the covenant which he had made with
his father.

Moroni 1:33
 33 And he also made a record of the captivity of his
father; therefore he had obtained the bones of the man that he
had brought down out of the water, which contained the name of the
man that had been slain; therefore he did write the names
of those who had been slain.

Moroni 1:34
 34 And he also made a record of the captivity of his
mother; therefore he had obtained the bones of the man that was
slain; therefore, he did write the names of those that had been
slain.

Moroni 1:35
 35 And he also made a record of the captivity of his
father; therefore he had obtained the bones of the man that was
slain by the hands of those who had been captured by the
nighting-places; therefore, he did write the names of those who
had been slain.

Moroni 2
Chapter 2

Moroni 2:1
 1 And now I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning the testimony of
Joseph Smith, which is delivered unto the people by the power of God.

Moroni 2:2
 2 Behold, I would speak somewhat concerning the preservation of those
records which are preserved; for behold, the records were not
stolen from the people, but they were delivered unto Joseph Smith by
the power of God.

Moroni 2:3
 3 And now I do not write the whole words of the record, of which I
am now speaking; for hearkeneth unto the words of the record which
was delivered unto him by the record which was given unto him by
the book.

Moroni 2:4
 4 But behold, I will write the remainder of the record; for I do not
write the record which was given by the record; for the record
concerning the plates of brass is given in the book; therefore
I speak only as I have written the record.

Moroni 2:5
 5 For the record was taken from the plates of brass, and
concerning the plates of Nephi it was written.

Moroni 2:6
 6 And behold,d upon the earth, that he might obtain the bones which
had been laid upon the earth.

Moroni 1:32
 32 And he did make a record of the covenant which he had made with
his father.

Moroni 1:33
 33 And he also made a record of the captivity of his
father; therefore he had obtained the bones of the man that he
had brought down out of the water, which contained the name of the
man that had been slain; therefore he did write the names
of those who had been slain.

Moroni 1:34
 34 And he also made a record of the captivity of his
mother; therefore he had obtained the bones of the man that was
slain; therefore, he did write the names of those that had been
slain.

Moroni 1:35
 35 And he also made a record of the captivity of his
father; therefore he had obtained the bones of the man that was
slain by the hands of those who had been captured by the
nighting-places; therefore, he did write the names of those who
had been slain.

Moroni 2

Moroni 2:1
 1 And now I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning the testimony of
Joseph Smith, which is delivered unto the people by the power of God.

Moroni 2:2
 2 Behold, I would speak somewhat concerning the preservation of those
records which are preserved; for behold, the records were not
stolen from the people, but they were delivered unto Joseph Smith by
the power of God.

Moroni 2:3
 3 And now I do not write the whole words of the record, of which I
am now speaking; for hearkeneth unto the words of the record which
was delivered unto him by the record which was given unto him by
the book.

Moroni 2:4
 4 But behold, I will write the remainder of the record; for I do not
write the record which was given by the record; for the record
concerning the plates of brass is given in the book; therefore
I speak only as I have written the record.

Moroni 2:5
 5 For the record was taken from the plates of brass, and
concerning the plates of Nephi it was written.

Moroni 2:6
 6 And behold, these plates were laid before the people,
and they were received by those who came upon the land of
Ishmael; therefore they were despatched round about the land of
Ishmael.

Moroni 2:7
 7 And Joseph Smith, the record-keeper, also took the
record, which contained the account of the wars and contentions
among the people, and also the account of the construction of the
great temple; and also the account of the making of vessels from
the sea; and many of the things which he had seen he had
permitted himself to write.

Moroni 2:8
 8 And he also made a record of the construction of the great
temple; and also of the making of plates of gold; and many of
these things he hath written in his own mouth.

Moroni 2:9
 9 And he also hath written many things which he hath written in
his own mouth; and these plates are called the record which were
gave unto him by the book.

Moroni 2:10
 10 And it came to pass that after he had made the records
which were given unto him by the book, he cast
his eyes about upon the land, which was possessed by the people
of the Lord; and behold, he beheld that his people were in a
state of great dissensions; and that the people of the city of
Ishmael, who were the people of the city of Middoni, were
wounded exceedingly because of their iniquity; and they returned to
their land.

Moroni 2:11
 11 And behold, the people of the city of Ishmael, who were the people
of the land, also returned to their land; and they did
not return to their land until they had assembled themselves
together in the land of Middoni.

Moroni 2:12
 12 And they did assemble themselves together in the land of
Ishmael; and they had built temples, and solemnly
suffered that their children should be holy, according to the
covenant which they had made which they had made with
their father.

Moroni 2:13
 13 And it came to pass that the people of the city of Ishmael
did assemble themselves together in the land of Ishmael,
every one according to his age; fromtes were laid before the people,
and they were received by those who came upon the land of
Ishmael; therefore they were despatched round about the land of
Ishmael.

Moroni 2:7
 7 And Joseph Smith, the record-keeper, also took the
record, which contained the account of the wars and contentions
among the people, and also the account of the construction of the
great temple; and also the account of the making of vessels from
the sea; and many of the things which he had seen he had
permitted himself to write.

Moroni 2:8
 8 And he also made a record of the construction of the great
temple; and also of the making of plates of gold; and many of
these things he hath written in his own mouth.

Moroni 2:9
 9 And he also hath written many things which he hath written in
his own mouth; and these plates are called the record which were
gave unto him by the book.

Moroni 2:10
 10 And it came to pass that after he had made the records
which were given unto him by the book, he cast
his eyes about upon the land, which was possessed by the people
of the Lord; and behold, he beheld that his people were in a
state of great dissensions; and that the people of the city of
Ishmael, who were the people of the city of Middoni, were
wounded exceedingly because of their iniquity; and they returned to
their land.

Moroni 2:11
 11 And behold, the people of the city of Ishmael, who were the people
of the land, also returned to their land; and they did
not return to their land until they had assembled themselves
together in the land of Middoni.

Moroni 2:12
 12 And they did assemble themselves together in the land of
Ishmael; and they had built temples, and solemnly
suffered that their children should be holy, according to the
covenant which they had made which they had made with
their father.

Moroni 2:13
 13 And it came to pass that the people of the city of Ishmael
did assemble themselves together in the land of Ishmael,
every one according to his age; from child to child they
did assemble themselves together, until they had gathered themselves
together in the land of Ishmael.

Moroni 2:14
 14 And it came to pass that they did build a ship; and they
wrought of old, and also all the sacred things which had
been handed down, which were sacred unto the Lord.

Moroni 2:15
 15 And it came to pass that they did make a ship, and
did call the name of the river; and they called it the
aqueduct.

Moroni 2:16
 16 And it came to pass that they did travel in the
fisheries of the river, until they came across the
waters of the Red Sea; and thus they did cross the waters of
the Red Sea and came up through the center of the land,
and were lost in the wilderness for many days.

Moroni 2:17
 17 And it came to pass that they did not return; and they
took the records, which contained the more part of the
words of the prophets, and journeyed again across the
waters of the Red Sea; and they were lost in the wilderness for
many days.

Moroni 2:18
 18 And on the morrow they did return; and thus they did journey
again across the waters of the Red Sea; and they were lost in the
wilderness for the space of many days; and they returned to the
city of Ishmael, and were received into the church of the Lord
God.

Moroni 2:19
 19 And it came to pass that they did take the record, which
contained the more sacred records which had been kept of
the holy order of God, and they did write upon the plates of
iron all the records which had been kept by the people of
God, which were pertaining to the holy order of God, which was
preserved in the earth by the gift and power of God, which
had been restored unto them by his resurrection.

Chapter 3

Moroni 3:1
 1 And now it came to pass that after the people of
Ishmael were made acquainted with the things which the Lord
had shown unto them, they were desirous to know
whether he should testify, or teach, or preach unto them,
concerning the restoration of their records, which had
been lost, in the wildernessdid assemble themselves together, until they had gathered themselves
together in the land of Ishmael.

Moroni 2:14
 14 And it came to pass that they did build a ship; and they
wrought of old, and also all the sacred things which had
been handed down, which were sacred unto the Lord.

Moroni 2:15
 15 And it came to pass that they did make a ship, and
did call the name of the river; and they called it the
aqueduct.

Moroni 2:16
 16 And it came to pass that they did travel in the
fisheries of the river, until they came across the
waters of the Red Sea; and thus they did cross the waters of
the Red Sea and came up through the center of the land,
and were lost in the wilderness for many days.

Moroni 2:17
 17 And it came to pass that they did not return; and they
took the records, which contained the more part of the
words of the prophets, and journeyed again across the
waters of the Red Sea; and they were lost in the wilderness for
many days.

Moroni 2:18
 18 And on the morrow they did return; and thus they did journey
again across the waters of the Red Sea; and they were lost in the
wilderness for the space of many days; and they returned to the
city of Ishmael, and were received into the church of the Lord
God.

Moroni 2:19
 19 And it came to pass that they did take the record, which
contained the more sacred records which had been kept of
the holy order of God, and they did write upon the plates of
iron all the records which had been kept by the people of
God, which were pertaining to the holy order of God, which was
preserved in the earth by the gift and power of God, which
had been restored unto them by his resurrection.

Chapter 3

Moroni 3:1
 1 And now it came to pass that after the people of
Ishmael were made acquainted with the things which the Lord
had shown unto them, they were desirous to know
whether he should testify, or teach, or preach unto them,
concerning the restoration of their records, which had
been lost, in the wilderness.

Moroni 3:2
 2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto them:

Moroni 3:3
 3 Yea, I say unto you, that these records have been
lost in the wilderness; behold, I have searched them, and I
have found that they have many things written
concerning my people, which have been hard for them to
understand.

Moroni 3:4
 4 And they have been put through much themost
difficulties; yea, even the most grievous of them all.

Moroni 3:5
 5 And the Lord said unto them: Behold, I am commanded of
my Father that I should bring these things forth unto the
children of men.

Moroni 3:6
 6 And the Lord said unto them: Write the things
concerning these things which thou hast desired.

Moroni 3:7
 7 And it came to pass that they did write the things
concerning them which thou hast desired.

Moroni 3:8
 8 And behold, these things are written; and behold,
they are given unto the children of men according to their
desires.

Moroni 3:9
 9 And it came to pass that they were given unto Laban, that
he should write them, and seal them up; and that he should seal
them up, and hide them up unto the Lord, that the Lord
might know of their deliverance from the bands of death.

Moroni 3:10
 10 And it came to pass that they were delivered out of the
wilderness, by the hand of the Lord.

Moroni 3:11
 11 And they were delivered out of the wilderness by the
hand of the Lord in the wilderness; and they were taken by the
Lord before the thunderings and the lightnings of the city,
which was the city of Ishmael.

Moroni 3:12
 12 And they were taken by the Lord before the tempest,
which was the city of Ishmael.

Moroni 3:13
 13 And I, Moroni, did cause the people of Ishmael to
prepare a great multitude, of all men--both Jews and
Christians--for fear lest there should some part of the
people be destroyed by the tempest, because they believed in the
Son of God,storation of their records, which had
been lost, in the wilderness.

Moroni 3:2
 2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto them:

Moroni 3:3
 3 Yea, I say unto you, that these records have been
lost in the wilderness; behold, I have searched them, and I
have found that they have many things written
concerning my people, which have been hard for them to
understand.

Moroni 3:4
 4 And they have been put through much themost
difficulties; yea, even the most grievous of them all.

Moroni 3:5
 5 And the Lord said unto them: Behold, I am commanded of
my Father that I should bring these things forth unto the
children of men.

Moroni 3:6
 6 And the Lord said unto them: Write the things
concerning these things which thou hast desired.

Moroni 3:7
 7 And it came to pass that they did write the things
concerning them which thou hast desired.

Moroni 3:8
 8 And behold, these things are written; and behold,
they are given unto the children of men according to their
desires.

Moroni 3:9
 9 And it came to pass that they were given unto Laban, that
he should write them, and seal them up; and that he should seal
them up, and hide them up unto the Lord, that the Lord
might know of their deliverance from the bands of death.

Moroni 3:10
 10 And it came to pass that they were delivered out of the
wilderness, by the hand of the Lord.

Moroni 3:11
 11 And they were delivered out of the wilderness by the
hand of the Lord in the wilderness; and they were taken by the
Lord before the thunderings and the lightnings of the city,
which was the city of Ishmael.

Moroni 3:12
 12 And they were taken by the Lord before the tempest,
which was the city of Ishmael.

Moroni 3:13
 13 And I, Moroni, did cause the people of Ishmael to
prepare a great multitude, of all men--both Jews and
Christians--for fear lest there should some part of the
people be destroyed by the tempest, because they believed in the
Son of God, they being led away by the Spirit into the promised
land--

Moroni 3:14
 14 And now it came to pass that they did fast and pray
unto the Father in the name of the Son of God, that they
might enter into the promised land according to the
Father's commandments.

Moroni 3:15
 15 And they did enter into the promised land; and they
brought their records with them, and also their
wonders, and their languages, and their prophecies, and
their art, and their fine works, and all manner of
fine workmanship; and they were exceedingly thankful unto
the Father.

Moroni 3:16
 16 And it came to pass that they did remain in the promised land
for the space of three days.

Moroni 3:17
 17 And it came to pass that they did rest themselves from their
burdens, and from their troubles, and from their
afflictions, and from their whoredoms, which they had
wrought among themselves.

Moroni 3:18
 18 And it came to pass that they did return to the land of Ishmael,
and again began to prepare for war.

Moroni 3:19
 19 And it came to pass that on the fourth day of the
conflict, Moroni being mindful of the affairs of the people in
the land, he sent a proclamation among all the people,
saying:

Moroni 3:20
 20 Behold, I am commanded by my father, Moroni, and my
brethren, that every soul who shall live, or who shall
remain in the land after the resurrection of the dead,
shall come forth, according to the law of Moses, and shall be
righteous forever.

Moroni 3:21
 21 And now, I would speak somewhat concerning these things, that
perhaps I may persuade some of my brethren to believe in me, that
they may be lifted up at the last day, that I may not go down
into the earth with them.

Moroni 3:22
 22 But behold, I do not speak all the words of my father.

Moroni 3:23
 23 But behold, I speak of my brethren, the Lamanites; for
I perceive that they are moreuse they believed in the
Son of God, they being led away by the Spirit into the promised
land--

Moroni 3:14
 14 And now it came to pass that they did fast and pray
unto the Father in the name of the Son of God, that they
might enter into the promised land according to the
Father's commandments.

Moroni 3:15
 15 And they did enter into the promised land; and they
brought their records with them, and also their
wonders, and their languages, and their prophecies, and
their art, and their fine works, and all manner of
fine workmanship; and they were exceedingly thankful unto
the Father.

Moroni 3:16
 16 And it came to pass that they did remain in the promised land
for the space of three days.

Moroni 3:17
 17 And it came to pass that they did rest themselves from their
burdens, and from their troubles, and from their
afflictions, and from their whoredoms, which they had
wrought among themselves.

Moroni 3:18
 18 And it came to pass that they did return to the land of Ishmael,
and again began to prepare for war.

Moroni 3:19
 19 And it came to pass that on the fourth day of the
conflict, Moroni being mindful of the affairs of the people in
the land, he sent a proclamation among all the people,
saying:

Moroni 3:20
 20 Behold, I am commanded by my father, Moroni, and my
brethren, that every soul who shall live, or who shall
remain in the land after the resurrection of the dead,
shall come forth, according to the law of Moses, and shall be
righteous forever.

Moroni 3:21
 21 And now, I would speak somewhat concerning these things, that
perhaps I may persuade some of my brethren to believe in me, that
they may be lifted up at the last day, that I may not go down
into the earth with them.

Moroni 3:22
 22 But behold, I do not speak all the words of my father.

Moroni 3:23
 23 But behold, I speak of my brethren, the Lamanites; for
I perceive that they are more numerous than I, and this
because of their exceeding faith in the words and the
prophecies which they have received from the Lord.

Moroni 3:24
 24 For behold, I have told you that I have searched the records
of our fathers; and behold, I say unto you they have been
translated into our language; and I have given unto them
the words which the Lord hath commanded me, which are written
concerning us, and telling them concerning our fathers, and our
concerning that which was to come.

Moroni 3:25
 25 And they believe in me, and they believe that my words
shall be verified, and they know that the Lord liveth.

Moroni 3:26
 26 And behold, I am they. I am they that believe in me; and
they believe that Jesus is the Son of God.

Moroni 3:27
 27 And now I speak concerning that which I have written, which
contains the prophecies of Samuel, which were written concerning
the destruction of my people, the Nephites.

Moroni 3:28
 28 Now I do not write them in the books which are written
concerning us; but they are written in the books which
have been given to our father, Lehi.

Moroni 3:29
 29 Behold, I have written them in the language in which
they were written; therefore I do not write them in the
terrible language which they had in the land, which is
murderous.

Moroni 3:30
 30 But behold, I write them in the language in which they were
written, which is the language of peaceable writing.

Moroni 3:31
 31 And now they are not written in the horrible language in which
they were, which is the language of the murderer, which
has gained favor in the land;

Moroni 3:32
 32 And it is we, our fathers, who have kept them, that
we have preserved them; for behold, our records contain a
fulfilling of the prophecies; yea, and they have been fulfilled
unto us.

Moroni 3:33
 33 Behold, their record does contain a fulfulness of
their words; but it was not written by them; yea, and behold,
they have not written it because of our transgressions.

Moroni 3:34ir exceeding faith in the words and the
prophecies which they have received from the Lord.

Moroni 3:24
 24 For behold, I have told you that I have searched the records
of our fathers; and behold, I say unto you they have been
translated into our language; and I have given unto them
the words which the Lord hath commanded me, which are written
concerning us, and telling them concerning our fathers, and our
concerning that which was to come.

Moroni 3:25
 25 And they believe in me, and they believe that my words
shall be verified, and they know that the Lord liveth.

Moroni 3:26
 26 And behold, I am they. I am they that believe in me; and
they believe that Jesus is the Son of God.

Moroni 3:27
 27 And now I speak concerning that which I have written, which
contains the prophecies of Samuel, which were written concerning
the destruction of my people, the Nephites.

Moroni 3:28
 28 Now I do not write them in the books which are written
concerning us; but they are written in the books which
have been given to our father, Lehi.

Moroni 3:29
 29 Behold, I have written them in the language in which
they were written; therefore I do not write them in the
terrible language which they had in the land, which is
murderous.

Moroni 3:30
 30 But behold, I write them in the language in which they were
written, which is the language of peaceable writing.

Moroni 3:31
 31 And now they are not written in the horrible language in which
they were, which is the language of the murderer, which
has gained favor in the land;

Moroni 3:32
 32 And it is we, our fathers, who have kept them, that
we have preserved them; for behold, our records contain a
fulfilling of the prophecies; yea, and they have been fulfilled
unto us.

Moroni 3:33
 33 Behold, their record does contain a fulfulness of
their words; but it was not written by them; yea, and behold,
they have not written it because of our transgressions.

Moroni 3:34
 34 Behold, our transgressions will be written in the book
of life; for behold, the Lord hath shown unto me that we
must return again, and contend no more with our father,
neither at any time for the space of two years, neither
until the Lord shall manifest unto us our sufferings in the
land; and the Lord hath said that our sufferings in the land
were not small.

Moroni 3:35
 35 And I, Moroni, did show unto them our sufferings in the
land; and I did justify them by the many mercies which he
hath inflicted upon them.

Moroni 3:36
 36 And it came to pass that they suffered themselves that they
would take the plates of Nephi, and write the records which
thereof had been translated, in the language which was used by
our fathers, which was the language of their fathers.

Moroni 3:37
 37 And the Lord said unto me: I will show unto them that I am the
Lord their God, and they shall know that I am the Lord their
God.

Moroni 3:38
 38 And I, Moroni, said unto them: Behold, I have been commanded of
the Lord that this should be done; and I am he that showeth unto
them.

Moroni 3:39
 39 And it came to pass that they did tremble exceedingly, even as
father had commanded them; for behold, they had supposed that it was
me, but it was not me; and I am not; and they said: I am not; and
they cried, and also all the people who had gathered together
for the sake of the things which they had been taught by their
priests and their teachers.

Moroni 3:40
 40 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, began to write the
records which had hitherto been hid up, from the days of our
fathers; but behold, they would not receive them into the book,
whereby they might destroy the things which they had been taught by
their priests.

Moroni 3:41
 41 And I began to write the records, which had hitherto been
translated out of the plates of brass, and I knew it to be the aaphora
of the people, because of the wonderful things which had been made manifest
unto them by theransgressions will be written in the book
of life; for behold, the Lord hath shown unto me that we
must return again, and contend no more with our father,
neither at any time for the space of two years, neither
until the Lord shall manifest unto us our sufferings in the
land; and the Lord hath said that our sufferings in the land
were not small.

Moroni 3:35
 35 And I, Moroni, did show unto them our sufferings in the
land; and I did justify them by the many mercies which he
hath inflicted upon them.

Moroni 3:36
 36 And it came to pass that they suffered themselves that they
would take the plates of Nephi, and write the records which
thereof had been translated, in the language which was used by
our fathers, which was the language of their fathers.

Moroni 3:37
 37 And the Lord said unto me: I will show unto them that I am the
Lord their God, and they shall know that I am the Lord their
God.

Moroni 3:38
 38 And I, Moroni, said unto them: Behold, I have been commanded of
the Lord that this should be done; and I am he that showeth unto
them.

Moroni 3:39
 39 And it came to pass that they did tremble exceedingly, even as
father had commanded them; for behold, they had supposed that it was
me, but it was not me; and I am not; and they said: I am not; and
they cried, and also all the people who had gathered together
for the sake of the things which they had been taught by their
priests and their teachers.

Moroni 3:40
 40 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, began to write the
records which had hitherto been hid up, from the days of our
fathers; but behold, they would not receive them into the book,
whereby they might destroy the things which they had been taught by
their priests.

Moroni 3:41
 41 And I began to write the records, which had hitherto been
translated out of the plates of brass, and I knew it to be the aaphora
of the people, because of the wonderful things which had been made manifest
unto them by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 3:42
 42 Nevertheless, it did please them not, and they sought to destroy
the records. And behold, they were delivered up by the power of the
Holy Ghost into the hands of those who were in the land of
Concord, who had been converted by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 3:43
 43 And it came to pass that they said: We know that thou art the Lord thy
Lord, because thou hast been faithful according to the covenant which
thou made unto us.

Moroni 3:44
 44 And it came to pass that they were desirous to hear the
records; and they also looked for the plates of brass; and they
were found, but they could not find them.

Moroni 3:45
 45 And now, we know that the plates of brass have been hid up
from the time that the plates of brass were brought from the
lost land; therefore, they are kept and preserved by the power of
the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 3:46
 46 And they are kept and preserved by that same power which
granted unto the children of men the gift of translation, that they
might know the mysteries of the Father, and also that they might know the
Kishkumen;

Moroni 3:47
 47 Therefore, they are kept up by the power of that same
Holy Ghost which is in us, which gift is given unworthily,
unworthy of all obedience; for whoso receiveth not that gift, the
same doth not receive the gift, neither will he keep the
covenant which he hath made.

Moroni 3:48
 48 Now this is the power of the Holy Ghost which is in me: to
persuade, persuade, persuade, and entice away many hearts;
therefore I speak unto you, my beloved brethren. I know that thou
shalt all alike be the children of the Father and the Son.

Moroni 3:49
 49 And even now I say unto you, my beloved brethren, that the
Father knoweth all things; wherefore, he hath given me this
record.

Moroni 3:50
 50 And he hath said unto me: Look! and behold! all this
stuff which thou hast seen and heard I have written.
Look! and behold!m by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 3:42
 42 Nevertheless, it did please them not, and they sought to destroy
the records. And behold, they were delivered up by the power of the
Holy Ghost into the hands of those who were in the land of
Concord, who had been converted by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 3:43
 43 And it came to pass that they said: We know that thou art the Lord thy
Lord, because thou hast been faithful according to the covenant which
thou made unto us.

Moroni 3:44
 44 And it came to pass that they were desirous to hear the
records; and they also looked for the plates of brass; and they
were found, but they could not find them.

Moroni 3:45
 45 And now, we know that the plates of brass have been hid up
from the time that the plates of brass were brought from the
lost land; therefore, they are kept and preserved by the power of
the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 3:46
 46 And they are kept and preserved by that same power which
granted unto the children of men the gift of translation, that they
might know the mysteries of the Father, and also that they might know the
Kishkumen;

Moroni 3:47
 47 Therefore, they are kept up by the power of that same
Holy Ghost which is in us, which gift is given unworthily,
unworthy of all obedience; for whoso receiveth not that gift, the
same doth not receive the gift, neither will he keep the
covenant which he hath made.

Moroni 3:48
 48 Now this is the power of the Holy Ghost which is in me: to
persuade, persuade, persuade, and entice away many hearts;
therefore I speak unto you, my beloved brethren. I know that thou
shalt all alike be the children of the Father and the Son.

Moroni 3:49
 49 And even now I say unto you, my beloved brethren, that the
Father knoweth all things; wherefore, he hath given me this
record.

Moroni 3:50
 50 And he hath said unto me: Look! and behold! all this
stuff which thou hast seen and heard I have written.
Look! and behold! I write it so that thou mayest know that
it is true.

Moroni 3:51
 51 And he hath said: Look! and behold! when ye shall
see these things, then shalt thou know that I, Moroni, am a
son of the Father.

Moroni 3:52
 52 Behold, I am a man of God; a man of my father, who was
baptized in the waters of Mormon. I am he whom my father
baptized.

Moroni 3:53
 53 Behold, I am he who was prepared to receive the kingdom
of God from the Father, from the beginning of the world.
Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. Behold, I am the
Son of the Father.

Moroni 3:54
 54 Because I am a man of God, therefore I know that the Son
of the Father shall come in my name; and behold, whoso shall believe
on his own head shall be saved.

Moroni 3:55
 55 And now, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that, except
thou shalt keep the commandments of the Father, and the Son
of the Father, by faith on the Son, thou shalt be cut off from
the presence of the Lord.

Moroni 3:56
 56 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. I am he who was
baptized in the waters of Mormon. I am he of the church of God.

Moroni 3:57
 57 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. I am he of the
Father; thou shalt have eternal life. Thou shalt make bare his
sins and he shall bear up the penalty. The Son of the
Father hath given unto me life.

Moroni 3:58
 58 Behold, I am the Father and the Son; the Father, because I
am of the house of Israel; and thou shalt have eternal life; and
the Son, because I am of the house of Israel.

Moroni 3:59
 59 And the Father, because I am of the Father, giveth eternal
life unto all those that believe on my name; and he shall manifest
himself unto all those who believe in me, in the flesh; for he
shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh.
Look! and behold! all this
stuff which thou hast seen and heard I have written.
Look! and behold! I write it so that thou mayest know that
it is true.

Moroni 3:51
 51 And he hath said: Look! and behold! when ye shall
see these things, then shalt thou know that I, Moroni, am a
son of the Father.

Moroni 3:52
 52 Behold, I am a man of God; a man of my father, who was
baptized in the waters of Mormon. I am he whom my father
baptized.

Moroni 3:53
 53 Behold, I am he who was prepared to receive the kingdom
of God from the Father, from the beginning of the world.
Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. Behold, I am the
Son of the Father.

Moroni 3:54
 54 Because I am a man of God, therefore I know that the Son
of the Father shall come in my name; and behold, whoso shall believe
on his own head shall be saved.

Moroni 3:55
 55 And now, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that, except
thou shalt keep the commandments of the Father, and the Son
of the Father, by faith on the Son, thou shalt be cut off from
the presence of the Lord.

Moroni 3:56
 56 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. I am he who was
baptized in the waters of Mormon. I am he of the church of God.

Moroni 3:57
 57 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel. I am he of the
Father; thou shalt have eternal life. Thou shalt make bare his
sins and he shall bear up the penalty. The Son of the
Father hath given unto me life.

Moroni 3:58
 58 Behold, I am the Father and the Son; the Father, because I
am of the house of Israel; and thou shalt have eternal life; and
the Son, because I am of the house of Israel.

Moroni 3:59
 59 And the Father, because I am of the Father, giveth eternal
life unto all those that believe on my name; and he shall manifest
himself unto all those who believe in me, in the flesh; for he
shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh.

Moroni 3:60
 60 Behold, I am he of the fruit of thy loins, and have been
baptized in the waters of Mormon.

Moroni 3:61
 61 I am he who was conformed in the belly of the
fish; and he shall manifest himself unto thy fruit.

Moroni 3:62
 62 Behold, it was the fruit of mine eye that saw the land
of promise; therefore I know that thou shalt have eternal life; for
after this manner have I seen my father, and my mother, and my
father, and my great-grandfather; and behold they were all consigned to
a state of endless wo.

Moroni 3:63
 63 And now behold, my beloved brethren, what shall we do, that we
may be conformed in the flesh?

Moroni 3:64
 64 Behold, we have been speaking somewhat concerning that
conversion which is to come; but I would speak somewhat more.

Moroni 3:65
 65 Behold, I know that it is wisdom in the Father that we should
form in the flesh; for upon the hearts of many men is this
conversion prepared, that thereby they may be established in the
restorer's seat, even until a time shall come that they may be restored
to that which is restored them; thus I know that they are restored to
that which is restored them.

Moroni 3:66
 66 And now I speak concerning that restoration; for the Father
knoweth all things, and they are hid up even unto the
destruction of men.

Moroni 3:67
 67 Therefore, the Father hath commanded me, yea, even upon all
the face of the earth, save it be that upon this land shall they
be restored.

Moroni 3:68
 68 And now it came to pass that I, Moroni, did preach the
word unto the people upon all the face of the land; and they
knew not that the Father had commanded me.

Moroni 3:69
 69 And it came to pass that the word was proclaimed
unto all the people; and they did believe in the words which I
said. And I began to say unto them that the time cometh that
theythe flesh.

Moroni 3:60
 60 Behold, I am he of the fruit of thy loins, and have been
baptized in the waters of Mormon.

Moroni 3:61
 61 I am he who was conformed in the belly of the
fish; and he shall manifest himself unto thy fruit.

Moroni 3:62
 62 Behold, it was the fruit of mine eye that saw the land
of promise; therefore I know that thou shalt have eternal life; for
after this manner have I seen my father, and my mother, and my
father, and my great-grandfather; and behold they were all consigned to
a state of endless wo.

Moroni 3:63
 63 And now behold, my beloved brethren, what shall we do, that we
may be conformed in the flesh?

Moroni 3:64
 64 Behold, we have been speaking somewhat concerning that
conversion which is to come; but I would speak somewhat more.

Moroni 3:65
 65 Behold, I know that it is wisdom in the Father that we should

conversion prepared, that thereby they may be established in the
restorer's seat, even until a time shall come that they may be restored
to that which is restored them; thus I know that they are restored to
that which is restored them.

Moroni 3:66
 66 And now I speak concerning that restoration; for the Father
knoweth all things, and they are hid up even unto the
destruction of men.

Moroni 3:67
 67 Therefore, the Father hath commanded me, yea, even upon all
the face of the earth, save it be that upon this land shall they
be restored.

Moroni 3:68
 68 And now it came to pass that I, Moroni, did preach the
word unto the people upon all the face of the land; and they
knew not that the Father had commanded me.

Moroni 3:69
 69 And it came to pass that the word was proclaimed
unto all the people; and they did believe in the words which I
said. And I began to say unto them that the time cometh that
they shall be restored unto the true and living God.

Chapter 4

Moroni 4:1
 1 And it came to pass that the people did believe and
believe in the words which I said unto them.

Moroni 4:2
 2 And it came to pass that I did preach even unto all the
people, on the land which was chosen, who were in the land of
Zarahemla; and I did preach the word with energy because of
the blindness of the minds, that they did not believe the
words which I spake.

Moroni 4:3
 3 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:

Moroni 4:4
 4 Blessed art thou, Moroni; thou art the shepherd of this sheep;
behold, I am the Father.

Moroni 4:5
 5 And now, Moroni, I know the manner of thy walk; for thou hast
witnessed the house of Jacob; thou hast led them from one time to
another, and even hungered and was filled; and thou wast with
them, even according to their amount.

Moroni 4:6
 6 And thou also hast been with them, and caused that they should
tarry, and caused that they should partake of the things of
God, which were prepared from the foundation of the world.

Moroni 4:7
 7 Thou hast been the God of Jacob and Joseph, the God of Joseph
and also the God of Moses; and thou hast said, I am, and
behold I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:8
 8 Thou hast said, I am Giddianhi--yea, thou art Giddianhi, the
God of Israel.

Moroni 4:9
 9 And I knew thee, because I was a man; and I beheld that thou
art blessed; for thou wast in the flesh; and all this because of thy
belief in me.

Moroni 4:10
 10 Behold, thou hast been lifted up by man, and thou hast
witnessed that I have said: In thy name, O man, will I sacrifice
my flesh.

Moroni 4:11
 11 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:12
 12 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Mory unto them that the time cometh that
they shall be restored unto the true and living God.

Moroni 4:11
 11 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:12
 12 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:13
 13 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:14
 14 And thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:15
 15 And now I, Moroni, do know that thou hast been lifted up by
man, and thou hast been seen of men, and thou hast heard my
voice; for thou beheldest that I was lifted up by men, and also
that others heard my voice.

Moroni 4:16
 16 But now, Moroni, I know that thou hast been lifted up by
me; and thou art my servant; and I am thy God.

Moroni 4:17
 17 Thou art my servant; and thou shalt do as I do. And if thou
wilt keep my commandments, thou shalt be my servant; and if thouwilt
not keep my commandments, thou shalt be cut off from the face of the
earth; for I the Lord am thy master.

Moroni 4:18
 18 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I know that it is thou; and
thou shalt do as I have commanded thee; for on the morrow thou shalt
be with my servant Giddianhi; and he shall be with me always in the
presence of mine Only Begotten Son, to take away the guilt of my
transgressor. Amen.

Chapter 5

Moroni 5:1
 1 Behold, I declare unto thee a holy scripture; and it is the
holy scriptures which shall be taught in all the churches of
God.

Moroni 5:2
 2 And I write it among my holy books; and it shall be kept
by the church in remembrance of the voice which said:

Moroni 5:3
 3 The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob; therefore, the Lord
hath sanctified his name.

Moroni 5:4
 4 And after this manner did the Lord make himself known unto
Jacob. For he said: If my servant Laman, whom I have
blessed with mine Only Begotten Son, should find mine
treasures found hid in the earth, I would that he should write
the names of the things that he 4:12
 12 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:13
 13 And also, thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:14
 14 And thou hast said: I am Giddianhi.

Moroni 4:15
 15 And now I, Moroni, do know that thou hast been lifted up by
man, and thou hast been seen of men, and thou hast heard my
voice; for thou beheldest that I was lifted up by men, and also
that others heard my voice.

Moroni 4:16

me; and thou art my servant; and I am thy God.

Moroni 4:17

 2 And I write it among my holy books; and it shall be kept
by the church in remembrance of the voice which said:

Moroni 5:3
 3 The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob; therefore, the Lord
hath sanctified his name.

Moroni 5:4
 4 And after this manner did the Lord make himself known unto
Jacob. For he said: If my servant Laman, whom I have
blessed with mine Only Begotten Son, should find mine
treasures found hid in the earth, I would that he should write
the names of the things that he hath kept secret.

Moroni 5:5
 5 And it came to pass that when he had said these words, he
wrote them upon the plates of brass; and he hid them
away in a manner which no man had before done.

Moroni 5:6
 6 For he said: If my servant Laman should find mine
treasures he would that I should write the names of them in
silk.

Moroni 5:7
 7 And it came to pass that when he had said these words, he
wrote the things which were engraven upon the
plates of brass on the plates of Nephi, which were
sealed.

Moroni 5:8
 8 And he hid them away in a manner which no man
had before done.

Moroni 5:9
 9 And it came to pass that when he had hid them away
in a manner that no one knew concerning them, he wrote
them upon the plates of Nephi, which were
sealed.

Moroni 5:10
 10 And he wrote them upon plates which he had made with
his own hands; and he hid them away in a manner that no
one could find them.

Moroni 5:11
 11 And it came to pass that when he had hid them away
in a manner that no one knew of them, he went and took
of the treasure which he had kept concealed in the earth.

Moroni 5:12
 12 And he went and took of the earth which was broken up
by the earth beneath him; and he found the things which he had
kept concealed in the earth.

Moroni 5:13
 13 And he said: Behold, I am Laman, and this is the record
which I have made with mine own hand, of my father.

Moroni 5:14
 14 And I make it according to the spirit which I have in
me, with mine own finger; but I do not write the
words which others have written; therefore I do not write them
which others have written.

Moroni 5:15
 15 And it came to pass that they were written by a
man whom the Lord had prepared.

Moroni 5:16
 16 And he finished his record; and the words which he
written were these: I am a man, and this is the
record which I have made with mine own hands, andthat when he had said these words, he
wrote them upon the plates of brass; and he hid them
away in a manner which no man had before done.

Moroni 5:6
 6 For he said: If my servant Laman should find mine
treasures he would that I should write the names of them in
silk.

Moroni 5:7
 7 And it came to pass that when he had said these words, he
wrote the things which were engraven upon the
plates of brass on the plates of Nephi, which were
sealed.

Moroni 5:8
 8 And he hid them away in a manner which no man
had before done.

Moroni 5:9
 9 And it came to pass that when he had hid them away
in a manner that no one knew concerning them, he wrote
them upon the plates of Nephi, which were
sealed.

Moroni 5:10
 10 And he wrote them upon plates which he had made with
his own hands; and he hid them away in a manner that no
one could find them.

Moroni 5:11
 11 And it came to pass that when he had hid them away
in a manner that no one knew of them, he went and took
of the treasure which he had kept concealed in the earth.

Moroni 5:12
 12 And he went and took of the earth which was broken up
by the earth beneath him; and he found the things which he had
kept concealed in the earth.

Moroni 5:13
 13 And he said: Behold, I am Laman, and this is the record
which I have made with mine own hand, of my father.

Moroni 5:14
 14 And I make it according to the spirit which I have in
me, with mine own finger; but I do not write the
words which others have written; therefore I do not write them
which others have written.

Moroni 5:15
 15 And it came to pass that they were written by a
man whom the Lord had prepared.

Moroni 5:16
 16 And he finished his record; and the words which he
written were these: I am a man, and this is the
record which I have made with mine own hands, and I
have commanded my children that they should write.

Moroni 5:17
 17 But I command you that they should not write the words
which have been spoken by me, which have been written
by this man.

Moroni 5:18
 18 For behold, he hath commanded my children to write the
words which have been spoken by him, which he hath
commanded them to write.

Moroni 5:19
 19 And it came to pass that when my children had finished
their work, they took of the earth which was broken up,
and they cast their writings upon the dust; and they
showed me their works, that I knew them not.

Moroni 5:20
 20 And it came to pass that I knew them not, neither did my
father.

Moroni 5:21
 21 And it came to pass that he took the record which had
been hid away, and he gathereth it from the earth.

Moroni 5:22
 22 And it came to pass that he made a graven image of the
earth, of the size of a man, and he made the face of the
earth like unto a profile, and he gathereth it upon the
stones of the mountains.

Moroni 5:23
 23 And now, when my father was engraven upon the plates of
blessing, (and I being little) he becometh to hide them away
in the earth; therefore, I have read them unto thee, that thou
shalt not find, that thou mayest find them among the
departed writings.

Moroni 5:24
 24 And it came to pass in the days of king Mosiah the people
of the church were seduced by the false doctrines of the
baptists, which were taught by the devil, who is the governor
of this hell.

Moroni 5:25
 25 And it came to pass that the people began to be glad in
wickedness; therefore, they sought to destroy my father, and he
become a god to them.

Moroni 5:26
 26 Therefore, being filled with the love of God, behold, I
appear before thee and in the flesh; and I am a man, and a
man of God, and am sent to bear the record, which hath been
brought out of the earth, which records the dealings of our
fathers write.

Moroni 5:17
 17 But I command you that they should not write the words
which have been spoken by me, which have been written
by this man.

Moroni 5:18
 18 For behold, he hath commanded my children to write the
words which have been spoken by him, which he hath
commanded them to write.

Moroni 5:19
 19 And it came to pass that when my children had finished
their work, they took of the earth which was broken up,
and they cast their writings upon the dust; and they
showed me their works, that I knew them not.

Moroni 5:20
 20 And it came to pass that I knew them not, neither did my
father.

Moroni 5:21
 21 And it came to pass that he took the record which had
been hid away, and he gathereth it from the earth.

Moroni 5:22
 22 And it came to pass that he made a graven image of the
earth, of the size of a man, and he made the face of the
earth like unto a profile, and he gathereth it upon the
stones of the mountains.

Moroni 5:23
 23 And now, when my father was engraven upon the plates of
blessing, (and I being little) he becometh to hide them away
in the earth; therefore, I have read them unto thee, that thou
shalt not find, that thou mayest find them among the
departed writings.

Moroni 5:24
 24 And it came to pass in the days of king Mosiah the people
of the church were seduced by the false doctrines of the
baptists, which were taught by the devil, who is the governor
of this hell.

Moroni 5:25
 25 And it came to pass that the people began to be glad in
wickedness; therefore, they sought to destroy my father, and he
become a god to them.

Moroni 5:26
 26 Therefore, being filled with the love of God, behold, I
appear before thee and in the flesh; and I am a man, and a
man of God, and am sent to bear the record, which hath been
brought out of the earth, which records the dealings of our
fathers from generation to generation.

Moroni 5:27
 27 Behold, the records are called the plates of Moses; and
the first ones were handed down, from generation to generation
until the days of king Mosiah.

Moroni 5:28
 28 Yea, and even from that time a great mystery was
hiddeth upon the plates; and whenever my father would read
them, lest he should find mine engravings he would say unto
me: The plates are cursed, and have gone astray.

Moroni 5:29
 29 But behold, the Lord hath comforted his people in this
mystery, and hath led away the hearts of some to seek
deeper things; yea, even that thou shalt find the records upon
the plates, and they shall be kept and handed down from one
generation to another until they shall be found, and also the
eighth books of Moses, which are not yet written, and
which must be written concerning the people whom the Lord
hath led away out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:30
 30 Yea, and also the prophecies and the geographers, which
must be written and concerning the people who were in the
wilderness.

Moroni 5:31
 31 And behold, I am he who did do these things; yea, I am the
man who did write the records; and I know thy plans.

Moroni 5:32
 32 Behold, I am he who brought these things forth unto thy children;
and they are they who have been kept back by the Lord.

Moroni 5:33
 33 And behold, I know that they shall be found, for the Lord
hath said unto me: Write these records and bring them forth
unto thy children, that they may be hid away in the earth;
yea, that thou mayest have them again of thy children, that
thy large might be the measure of thy small, that they may be
conferred upon the children of men.

Moroni 5:34
 34 And it came to pass that I said unto my father: I will
write the records and bring them forth unto thy children, and
they shall be kept and handed down from one generation to another.

Moroni 5:35
 35 And it came to pass that I said unto my father: I knowold, the records are called the plates of Moses; and
the first ones were handed down, from generation to generation
until the days of king Mosiah.

Moroni 5:28
 28 Yea, and even from that time a great mystery was
hiddeth upon the plates; and whenever my father would read
them, lest he should find mine engravings he would say unto
me: The plates are cursed, and have gone astray.

Moroni 5:29
 29 But behold, the Lord hath comforted his people in this
mystery, and hath led away the hearts of some to seek
deeper things; yea, even that thou shalt find the records upon
the plates, and they shall be kept and handed down from one
generation to another until they shall be found, and also the
eighth books of Moses, which are not yet written, and
which must be written concerning the people whom the Lord
hath led away out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:30
 30 Yea, and also the prophecies and the geographers, which
must be written and concerning the people who were in the
wilderness.

Moroni 5:31
 31 And behold, I am he who did do these things; yea, I am the
man who did write the records; and I know thy plans.

Moroni 5:32
 32 Behold, I am he who brought these things forth unto thy children;
and they are they who have been kept back by the Lord.

Moroni 5:33
 33 And behold, I know that they shall be found, for the Lord
hath said unto me: Write these records and bring them forth
unto thy children, that they may be hid away in the earth;
yea, that thou mayest have them again of thy children, that
thy large might be the measure of thy small, that they may be
conferred upon the children of men.

Moroni 5:34
 34 And it came to pass that I said unto my father: I will
write the records and bring them forth unto thy children, and
they shall be kept and handed down from one generation to another.

Moroni 5:35
 35 And it came to pass that I said unto my father: I know that
the records and the geographers must surely come forth unto thy children.

Moroni 5:36
 36 And it came to pass that I wrote the records and the
geographers, and caused that they should be kept and brought forth
unto my father.

Moroni 5:37
 37 And it came to pass that I caused that the plates
should be brought forth upon which was engraven the
seventieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Israel.

Moroni 5:38
 38 And I also caused that the engravings should be
made known unto my father, and that he should make the
orders in the mount of assembly which he had made, for
the Lord had commanded him.

Moroni 5:39
 39 For I, Moroni, having been a man of the Lord, (having
praised him above all men) yea, and also having had many
days of fasting and praying before him, I said: O Lord, thou hast
commanded me that I should pray. And I say unto you, that if I
had not done this thou wouldst not have commanded me that I should do
this thing.

Moroni 5:40
 40 But behold, thou hast commanded me that I should do it, and I
am obedient unto thy word.

Moroni 5:41
 41 And now, my father, I know that if I had not done these things
that I should have repented not of the things which I have done.

Moroni 5:42
 42 But behold, I have done them, and I know that thou wouldst
have kept me in remembrance of thy word.

Moroni 5:43
 43 And I know that thou wouldst keep me in remembrance of thy
word; for thou wouldst have told me concerning the destruction of
the people of the city of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:44
 44 And I know that if I had not told thee that the people of
the city had gathered together their people and departed
out of the land, that the people of that city would have been
destroyed.

Moroni 5:45
 45 But behold, I have told thee that as the Lord liveth,
even so I will keep my daughter, Moroni, and keep her
safe until the Lord shall bring her again out of the land of
Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:46
 46 And as I live, and am,rs must surely come forth unto thy children.

Moroni 5:36
 36 And it came to pass that I wrote the records and the
geographers, and caused that they should be kept and brought forth
unto my father.

Moroni 5:37
 37 And it came to pass that I caused that the plates
should be brought forth upon which was engraven the
seventieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Israel.

Moroni 5:38
 38 And I also caused that the engravings should be
made known unto my father, and that he should make the
orders in the mount of assembly which he had made, for
the Lord had commanded him.

Moroni 5:39
 39 For I, Moroni, having been a man of the Lord, (having
praised him above all men) yea, and also having had many
days of fasting and praying before him, I said: O Lord, thou hast
commanded me that I should pray. And I say unto you, that if I
had not done this thou wouldst not have commanded me that I should do
this thing.

Moroni 5:40
 40 But behold, thou hast commanded me that I should do it, and I
am obedient unto thy word.

Moroni 5:41
 41 And now, my father, I know that if I had not done these things
that I should have repented not of the things which I have done.

Moroni 5:42
 42 But behold, I have done them, and I know that thou wouldst
have kept me in remembrance of thy word.

Moroni 5:43
 43 And I know that thou wouldst keep me in remembrance of thy
word; for thou wouldst have told me concerning the destruction of
the people of the city of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:44
 44 And I know that if I had not told thee that the people of
the city had gathered together their people and departed
out of the land, that the people of that city would have been
destroyed.

Moroni 5:45
 45 But behold, I have told thee that as the Lord liveth,
even so I will keep my daughter, Moroni, and keep her
safe until the Lord shall bring her again out of the land of
Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:46
 46 And as I live, and am, and shall be, she shall be preserved by
the power of the Lord among the house of Jacob; and as the Lord
liveth, and shall be, she shall be preserved by the power of the Lord
from the day that she shall testify of the Messiah.

Moroni 5:47
 47 Behold, I am she; and am thy brother, thou brother of Jared; and
thou also art made a king over the land according to the
ordinances of the house of Jacob; therefore, thou shalt take
thy daughter, the daughter of thy brother, and shall name her
after me; and thou shalt give her unto another man to be his wife;
for this cause shall thy father and thy mother be remembered;
for thou shalt be called the daughter of thy father.

Moroni 5:48
 48 And the words of thy father shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am he.
Moroni 5:49
 49 Behold, thou shalt write the things which thou shalt write; for
they shall be things which thou shalt write and shalt
write again.

Moroni 5:50
 50 And thou shalt write also the things which thou shalt write
concerning thy people, O house of Israel. Behold, I am he that taketh
upon me the name of our father, our great-grandfather; and we
have been brought out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:51
 51 Behold, I am he that taketh upon me the name of our father, the
Lord our God. Behold, thou shalt write the things which thou shalt
write; for they shall be things which thou shalt write and
write again.

Moroni 5:52
 52 And thou shalt write also the things which thou shalt write concerning
thy people, O house of Israel.

Moroni 5:53
 53 Now this is the writing which thou shalt write; and thou shalt write
of my glory, and thy many many joys and sorrows; and they shall
be hid up, as in a vault, until they shall be light of body and
of spirit, that they can be read by the understanding of men.

Moroni 5:54
 54 Thou shalt write also the things which thou shalt write,
concerning thy children.

Moroni 5:55
 55 And whatsoever and am, and shall be, she shall be preserved by
the power of the Lord among the house of Jacob; and as the Lord
liveth, and shall be, she shall be preserved by the power of the Lord
from the day that she shall testify of the Messiah.

Moroni 5:47
 47 Behold, I am she; and am thy brother, thou brother of Jared; and
thou also art made a king over the land according to the
ordinances of the house of Jacob; therefore, thou shalt take
thy daughter, the daughter of thy brother, and shall name her
after me; and thou shalt give her unto another man to be his wife;
for this cause shall thy father and thy mother be remembered;
for thou shalt be called the daughter of thy father.

Moroni 5:48
 48 And the words of thy father shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am he.
Moroni 5:49
 49 Behold, thou shalt write the things which thou shalt write; for
they shall be things which thou shalt write and shalt
write again.

Moroni 5:50
 50 And thou shalt write also the things which thou shalt write
concerning thy people, O house of Israel. Behold, I am he that taketh
upon me the name of our father, our great-grandfather; and we
have been brought out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:51
 51 Behold, I am he that taketh upon me the name of our father, the
Lord our God. Behold, thou shalt write the things which thou shalt
write; for they shall be things which thou shalt write and
write again.

Moroni 5:52
 52 And thou shalt write also the things which thou shalt write concerning
thy people, O house of Israel.

Moroni 5:53
 53 Now this is the writing which thou shalt write; and thou shalt write
of my glory, and thy many many joys and sorrows; and they shall
be hid up, as in a vault, until they shall be light of body and
of spirit, that they can be read by the understanding of men.

Moroni 5:54
 54 Thou shalt write also the things which thou shalt write,
concerning thy children.

Moroni 5:55
 55 And whatsoever thing of my glory thou shalt write, write it
concerning thy children; for they shall be gathered together
again, and shall be brought down to thee in the flesh.

Moroni 5:56
 56 But this is not all; for I am he of whom Moses spake, saying:
Reproach not the Lord, the Lord will not be ashamed.

Moroni 5:57
 57 Therefore, the Lord will be ashamed that shall write this,
but shall not write it.

Moroni 5:58
 58 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto Moses: Art thou,
Lord, our God?

Moroni 5:59
 59 Moses said: I am.

Moroni 5:60
 60 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto him: Thou art my
God.

Moroni 5:61
 61 And it came to pass that Moses said unto him: Is it not written
in another man's heart that I should lie down in the dust,
that I should not be among the ruins of the city?

Moroni 5:62
 62 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto him: Verily, verily, I
am, I am he that did lie down in the dust; and I have been
constructed of the dust; and I unto myself am God.

Moroni 5:63
 63 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto Moses: As I live,
even so shall ye be among the ruins of the city.

Moroni 5:64
 64 Ye shall build up again a city, and shall be called Zion. And
it shall be a holy city, and ye shall be called the people of the
Holy One of Israel.

Moroni 5:65
 65 And the Lord said unto Moses: He that buildeth in Zion
the tabernacle of the Lord, the holy place, shall be exalted
above that which is above.

Moroni 5:66
 66 And he that buildeth in Zion, the tabernacle of the Lord,
shall be cut off from off the face of the land.

Moroni 5:67
 67 And he that built in Zion, the holy place, shall be
hated, and shall be cast out.

Moroni 5:68
 68 Wherefore, the Lord said unto Moses: The demi-god shall
be destroyed from off the faceou shalt write,
concerning thy children.

Moroni 5:55
 55 And whatsoever thing of my glory thou shalt write, write it
concerning thy children; for they shall be gathered together
again, and shall be brought down to thee in the flesh.

Moroni 5:56
 56 But this is not all; for I am he of whom Moses spake, saying:
Reproach not the Lord, the Lord will not be ashamed.

Moroni 5:57
 57 Therefore, the Lord will be ashamed that shall write this,
but shall not write it.

Moroni 5:58
 58 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto Moses: Art thou,
Lord, our God?

Moroni 5:59
 59 Moses said: I am.

Moroni 5:60
 60 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto him: Thou art my
God.

Moroni 5:61
 61 And it came to pass that Moses said unto him: Is it not written
in another man's heart that I should lie down in the dust,
that I should not be among the ruins of the city?

Moroni 5:62
 62 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto him: Verily, verily, I
am, I am he that did lie down in the dust; and I have been
constructed of the dust; and I unto myself am God.

Moroni 5:63
 63 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto Moses: As I live,
even so shall ye be among the ruins of the city.

Moroni 5:64
 64 Ye shall build up again a city, and shall be called Zion. And
it shall be a holy city, and ye shall be called the people of the
Holy One of Israel.

Moroni 5:65
 65 And the Lord said unto Moses: He that buildeth in Zion
the tabernacle of the Lord, the holy place, shall be exalted
above that which is above.

Moroni 5:66
 66 And he that buildeth in Zion, the tabernacle of the Lord,
shall be cut off from off the face of the land.

Moroni 5:67
 67 And he that built in Zion, the holy place, shall be
hated, and shall be cast out.

Moroni 5:68
 68 Wherefore, the Lord said unto Moses: The demi-god shall
be destroyed from off the face of this land; for he shall be an
invisible spirit, and a spirit that shall not be known among
men.

Moroni 5:69
 69 But the spirit of the god who is in me, which is holy,
which is holy above all things, shall be manifested in him;
wherefore, Moses said unto him: As thou wilt hearken unto me,
and keep my commandments, thou shalt be a holy city, unto thy
soul delight; and I will make the heavens and the earth a way for
thy to pass, that the light of my God may shine upon thee.

Moroni 5:70
 70 Wherefore, Moses said unto him: As thou wilt that I should
redeign, and remain in the land of Jerusalem, thou shalt be a
protected city.

Moroni 5:71
 71 And he said: I know that as the Lord liveth he will not
delight me in the dark.

Moroni 5:72
 72 But Moses said unto him: Even as thou hast commanded me that
I should write this record, so I will that hearken unto thee, and
remain in the land of Jerusalem, while thou hast there give the
record, thou shalt be a city of the Lord.

Moroni 5:73
 73 And it came to pass that Moses said unto him: The Lord
hath commanded me that I should write this record; and also he hath
commanded me that I should give it unto my son.

Moroni 5:74
 74 Wherefore, if the Lord liveth thou shalt write the
record.

Moroni 5:75
 75 And it came to pass that thou hast written the
record, and this
records, according to the commandments of the Lord.

Moroni 5:76
 76 And behold, Moses is come to this great
presence; and he shall be a substitute for him.

Moroni 5:77
 77 And it shall come to pass that the Lord shall take
upon him the name of the great God; and he shall be called by
the voice of the Lord; and the voice of him shall be a
replacement.

Moroni 5:78
 78Lord said unto Moses: The demi-god shall
be destroyed from off the face of this land; for he shall be an
invisible spirit, and a spirit that shall not be known among
men.

Moroni 5:69
 69 But the spirit of the god who is in me, which is holy,
which is holy above all things, shall be manifested in him;
wherefore, Moses said unto him: As thou wilt hearken unto me,
and keep my commandments, thou shalt be a holy city, unto thy
soul delight; and I will make the heavens and the earth a way for
thy to pass, that the light of my God may shine upon thee.

Moroni 5:70
 70 Wherefore, Moses said unto him: As thou wilt that I should
redeign, and remain in the land of Jerusalem, thou shalt be a
protected city.

Moroni 5:71
 71 And he said: I know that as the Lord liveth he will not
delight me in the dark.

Moroni 5:72
 72 But Moses said unto him: Even as thou hast commanded me that
I should write this record, so I will that hearken unto thee, and
remain in the land of Jerusalem, while thou hast there give the
record, thou shalt be a city of the Lord.

Moroni 5:73
 73 And it came to pass that Moses said unto him: The Lord
hath commanded me that I should write this record; and also he hath
commanded me that I should give it unto my son.

Moroni 5:74
 74 Wherefore, if the Lord liveth thou shalt write the
record.

Moroni 5:75
 75 And it came to pass that thou hast written the
record, and this

Moroni 5:76
 76 And behold, Moses is come to this great
presence; and he shall be a substitute for him.

Moroni 5:77
 77 And it shall come to pass that the Lord shall take
upon him the name of the great God; and he shall be called by
the voice of the Lord; and the voice of him shall be a
replacement.

Moroni 5:78
 78 For behold, the Lord himself shall raise him from the
dead, and shall bring him down from the dead.

Moroni 5:79
 79 And it shall come to pass that the Lord will show unto thee
concerning the destruction of the records.

Moroni 5:80
 80 For behold, I said unto thee: The records shall be destroyed;
nevertheless they shall be kept; for they shall be kept
concerning the prophecies which shall be fulfilled.

Moroni 5:81
 81 Nevertheless, my son, the records shall be destroyed,
nevertheless; they shall be kept for a wise purpose.

Moroni 5:82
 82 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto
me: Do this, that I may prosper in the land, which
I have prepared for my people.

 83 And it shall come to pass that I shall prosper in the
land.

 84 And it shall come to pass that I will show unto thee that the
Lord hath covenanted with his people that I should be their king.

fail.

Moroni 5:87
 87 Therefore I will show unto thee a sign.

Moroni 5:88
 88 For as I live, even unto the end of my days, if the Lord God
shall call me by the name of the Lord, I will be his servant; for the
Lord hath also covenanted with me that I should be their king.

Moroni 5:89
 89 Therefore I will show unto thee a sign.

Moroni 5:90
 90 Behold, I am a man that liveth not and remembereth not.
I am a man that hath been lifted up of the heavens, that I
might tarry with the Father.

Moroni 5:91
 91 Behold, I am he that is lifted up. I am he that shall be
lifted up. I am he that shall be found. Behold, I am he.

Moroni 5:92

 80 For behold, I said unto thee: The records shall be destroyed;
nevertheless they shall be kept; for they shall be kept
concerning the prophecies which shall be fulfilled.

Moroni 5:81
 81 Nevertheless, my son, the records shall be destroyed,
nevertheless; they shall be kept for a wise purpose.

land.

Moroni 5:84
 84 And it shall come to pass that I will show unto thee that the
Lord hath covenanted with his people that I should be their king.

Moroni 5:85
 85 Wherefore, I will show unto thee that the Lord God hath covenanted
with my father that he should be their king.

Moroni 5:86
 86 Wherefore, I will show unto thee a sign that ye cannot
fail.

choose those servants whom the Lord shall take; and they shall
be confounded in the sight of the Lord, that they cannot be found
among the house of Israel; yet they shall be among the house of
Jacob.

Moroni 5:102

that ye cannot be kept in a state of innocence, neither be
kept from the knowledge of the knowledge of the law by the
merits of the Father.

be made known unto all those who are willing to hear, by the
Gentiles; for they shall know whether they are done well or
wicked; for they shall know according to the law which hath been given
unto them by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 5:110

 114 Behold, I am of the house of Israel.

Moroni 5:115
 115 Behold, I obeyed the voice of the Lord, and did prepare
my oven before him that I might eat bread.

Moroni 5:116
 116 And he blessed my table before him; and he spake many
concerning the house of Israel.

Moroni 5:117
 117 And he told me that the Lord should gather together
themselves together from the four quarters of the earth; and
they should come forth, and be joined together at their
borders, and they should be joined together at their borders.

Moroni 5:118
 118 And he also told me that the Lord should fulfill all
his words which he had spoken unto me, which he spake
unto me concerning them; and he also set my table before me,
and made it a feast.

Moroni 5:119
 119 And I also did before him bread, and wine, and oil; and we
did eat bread according to the words of the Lord.

Moroni 5:120
 120 And after we had all eaten bread in the place which
the Lord had prepared, he said unto me: Behold, here are
these three hundred and forty and two years from the
time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and behold, this is the land of
my inheritance.

Moroni 5:121
 121 And it shall be a land of liberty for them; and behold, mine
father hath written the land of my inheritance, which is the land
of Nephi, in the book which I have made.

Moroni 5:122
 122 And I know that I shall be blessed in the land. And I go
nowhere, for I know that the Lord shall prosper me. I have thought
concerning my father, and his other brethren; and the Lord hath
commanded me that I should write it. But I have not, and I have
written it.

Moroni 5:123
 123 Behold, I am of the house of Israel; and I am called
Nephi; and also my father hath been born among the house of
Israel.

Moroni 5:124
 124 And it shall come to pass that after the Lord shall have
brought his people out of the land of Jerusalem, he shall
take my father Israel.

Moroni 5:114
 114 Behold, I am of the house of Israel.

Moroni 5:115
 115 Behold, I obeyed the voice of the Lord, and did prepare
my oven before him that I might eat bread.

 123 Behold, I am of the house of Israel; and I am called
Nephi; and also my father hath been born among the house of
Israel.

Moroni 5:124
 124 And it shall come to pass that after the Lord shall have
brought his people out of the land of Jerusalem, he shall
take my father, and shall name me after that which I have
written.

Moroni 5:125
 125 And my father shall be called after that which I have
written. And after this manner shall my father be called.

Moroni 5:126
 126 And it shall come to pass that after my father hath
beheld that the Lord hath all power, he shall be made known unto
my mother, yea, even that which I have written.

Moroni 5:127
 127 And it shall come to pass that my mother shall be
comforted; therefore, she shall be comforted, until she
shall recover from the pains of her wounds that she hath no more
flesh.

Moroni 5:128
 128 And it shall come to pass, when she shall recover from the
pesions of her flesh, that my soul shall depart; and my spirit shall
be forever and ever with her.

Moroni 5:129
 129 And my soul shall be with her; my body with hers; and
our souls shall be one flesh.

Moroni 5:130
 130 Behold, my soul delighteth in the flesh; but I will be
wrought upon no flesh to fulfil the commandments of the Lord;
for the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as my people shall
remain in the land of Jerusalem, I will be merciful unto them, even unto
redemption.

Moroni 5:131
 131 Thus saith the Lord, in the beginning, when he first created the
earth, and all things which in him were created; thus have I seen
concerning all the creation of the earth:

Moroni 5:132
 132 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall say
concerning that day which shall be, even that day which shall be, that my
people shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.

Moroni 5:133
 133 Therefore, the Lord God hath said that: This is the first creation
of the earth; and it shall be the last creation, and the
destroyer of the first.

Moroni 5:134
 134 And I know that the Lord God hath said: This is the last
creation; and it shall be the first which shall be destroyed; and
their destruction shall be the cause of many sorrowings in the
paradise ofll name me after that which I have
written.

Moroni 5:125
 125 And my father shall be called after that which I have
written. And after this manner shall my father be called.

Moroni 5:126
 126 And it shall come to pass that after my father hath
beheld that the Lord hath all power, he shall be made known unto
my mother, yea, even that which I have written.

Moroni 5:127
 127 And it shall come to pass that my mother shall be
comforted; therefore, she shall be comforted, until she
shall recover from the pains of her wounds that she hath no more
flesh.

Moroni 5:128
 128 And it shall come to pass, when she shall recover from the
pesions of her flesh, that my soul shall depart; and my spirit shall
be forever and ever with her.

Moroni 5:129
 129 And my soul shall be with her; my body with hers; and
our souls shall be one flesh.

Moroni 5:130
 130 Behold, my soul delighteth in the flesh; but I will be
wrought upon no flesh to fulfil the commandments of the Lord;
for the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as my people shall
remain in the land of Jerusalem, I will be merciful unto them, even unto
redemption.

Moroni 5:131
 131 Thus saith the Lord, in the beginning, when he first created the
earth, and all things which in him were created; thus have I seen
concerning all the creation of the earth:

Moroni 5:132
 132 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall say
concerning that day which shall be, even that day which shall be, that my
people shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.

Moroni 5:133
 133 Therefore, the Lord God hath said that: This is the first creation
of the earth; and it shall be the last creation, and the
destroyer of the first.

Moroni 5:134
 134 And I know that the Lord God hath said: This is the last
creation; and it shall be the first which shall be destroyed; and
their destruction shall be the cause of many sorrowings in the
paradise of the saints.

Moroni 5:135
 135 Wherefore, my son, I know that if this be the last creation,
that destruction shall come upon the saints, and the grief of
their souls; yea, they shall be sorrowful even as they have
troubled before.

Moroni 5:136
 136 And after they have been sorrowful they shall be comforted;
they shall be lifted up at the last day; their sorrow shall
be turned unto joy.

Moroni 5:137
 137 And after they have been comforted they shall be brought down
to the earth; their sorrow shall be turned unto sorrow.

Moroni 5:138
 138 Thy children shall return to the earth, and also all thy
children; for the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as my
people shall desire of me, it shall be done unto them.

Moroni 5:139
 139 Behold, I am he that did speak; and I am he that is
spoken.

Moroni 5:140
 140 Behold, I am he that gave the record unto my father; and I
am he that has made it known unto you.

Moroni 5:141
 141 Behold, I am he that knoweth all things both before and
after that which hath been.

Moroni 5:142
 142 Behold, I am he that gave the record unto my father; and I
am he that knoweth all things from this time even down to the
present time.

Moroni 5:143
 143 Behold, I am he that gave the record unto my father; and I
am he that knoweth all the plates which containeth the
records.

Moroni 5:144
 144 Behold, I am he that knoweth all the kings and all the
lords of the people; wherefore I know all the thoughts of the hearts of
the people.

Moroni 5:145
 145 Wherefore, I, Moroni, write the words of my father, which he
hath commanded me.

Moroni 5:146
 146 And I, Moroni, am commanded of my father to write the
record which hath been handed down by the children of men even
until this time.

Moroni 5:147
 147 Behold, I write the words of my father; and the record
which I have made is a record fromf many sorrowings in the
paradise of the saints.

Moroni 5:135
 135 Wherefore, my son, I know that if this be the last creation,
that destruction shall come upon the saints, and the grief of
their souls; yea, they shall be sorrowful even as they have
troubled before.

Moroni 5:136
 136 And after they have been sorrowful they shall be comforted;
they shall be lifted up at the last day; their sorrow shall
be turned unto joy.

Moroni 5:137
 137 And after they have been comforted they shall be brought down
to the earth; their sorrow shall be turned unto sorrow.

Moroni 5:138
 138 Thy children shall return to the earth, and also all thy
children; for the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as my
people shall desire of me, it shall be done unto them.

Moroni 5:139
 139 Behold, I am he that did speak; and I am he that is
spoken.

Moroni 5:140
 140 Behold, I am he that gave the record unto my father; and I
am he that has made it known unto you.

Moroni 5:141
 141 Behold, I am he that knoweth all things both before and
after that which hath been.

Moroni 5:142
 142 Behold, I am he that gave the record unto my father; and I
am he that knoweth all things from this time even down to the
present time.

Moroni 5:143
 143 Behold, I am he that gave the record unto my father; and I
am he that knoweth all the plates which containeth the
records.

Moroni 5:144
 144 Behold, I am he that knoweth all the kings and all the
lords of the people; wherefore I know all the thoughts of the hearts of
the people.

Moroni 5:145
 145 Wherefore, I, Moroni, write the words of my father, which he
hath commanded me.

Moroni 5:146
 146 And I, Moroni, am commanded of my father to write the
record which hath been handed down by the children of men even
until this time.

Moroni 5:147
 147 Behold, I write the words of my father; and the record
which I have made is a record from the beginning of man, which
hath been handed down even from the creation of the world.

Moroni 5:148
 148 And the things which I have written are the record which my
father hath made; and the things which he hath made, they
are written in the plates which are in the vault of antiquity.

Moroni 5:149
 149 And the things which my father hath commanded me, and I
am compelled to make, I make them according to the commandments of my
father.

Moroni 5:150
 150 And I know that my father hath of old time kept the
record which his father hath made, which was engraven on the
plates of brass, which gave an account of the creation of the
earth.

Moroni 5:151
 151 And with the finger of his right hand he traced the
beginning of the earth; wherefore, he called the place Bountiful.

Moroni 5:152
 152 And he called it after the land of Bountiful; for, behold, the Lord
commanded Noah to build a ship and there dwell in the waters for
a place to hide.

Moroni 5:153
 153 Wherefore, the Lord commanded him that he should bring a man
into the world, and also all men. And the Lord said unto him:

Moroni 5:154
 154 Behold, I give this record; and also I command you that ye shall keep the
record which hath been engraven upon the plates of brass, from
the beginning of the world till this time.

Moroni 5:155
 155 And behold, I command you that ye shall engraven on the plates of
brass the names of all the land which the Lord hath blessed, and
which is a land for a place to hide.

Moroni 5:156
 156 And it came to pass that Noah, having received the
record from the Lord, did compass himself a land which was
called Desolation, which he called Desolation after the
desolation of the people in the earth; wherefore he did suffer the
hands of the Lord to be upon the land, that he might know the
interval which the people should be in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:157
 157 Therefore, having learned this of man, which
hath been handed down even from the creation of the world.

Moroni 5:148
 148 And the things which I have written are the record which my
father hath made; and the things which he hath made, they
are written in the plates which are in the vault of antiquity.

Moroni 5:149
 149 And the things which my father hath commanded me, and I
am compelled to make, I make them according to the commandments of my
father.

Moroni 5:150
 150 And I know that my father hath of old time kept the
record which his father hath made, which was engraven on the
plates of brass, which gave an account of the creation of the
earth.

Moroni 5:151
 151 And with the finger of his right hand he traced the
beginning of the earth; wherefore, he called the place Bountiful.

Moroni 5:152
 152 And he called it after the land of Bountiful; for, behold, the Lord
commanded Noah to build a ship and there dwell in the waters for
a place to hide.

Moroni 5:153
 153 Wherefore, the Lord commanded him that he should bring a man
into the world, and also all men. And the Lord said unto him:

Moroni 5:154
 154 Behold, I give this record; and also I command you that ye shall keep the
record which hath been engraven upon the plates of brass, from
the beginning of the world till this time.

Moroni 5:155
 155 And behold, I command you that ye shall engraven on the plates of
brass the names of all the land which the Lord hath blessed, and
which is a land for a place to hide.

Moroni 5:156
 156 And it came to pass that Noah, having received the
record from the Lord, did compass himself a land which was
called Desolation, which he called Desolation after the
desolation of the people in the earth; wherefore he did suffer the
hands of the Lord to be upon the land, that he might know the
interval which the people should be in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:157
 157 Therefore, having learned this, he caused the record which
had been hid up in the earth should be brought forth; and he
caused the people to gather together their things and
their seeds, and journey forth into the wilderness.

Moroni 5:158
 158 And thus they did find themselves in the borders of the land
Desolation, and also in the borders of the land, which
had been desolate since the days of man.

Moroni 5:159
 159 And they did establish cities, and villages, and the
people came forth into the wilderness, and began to
earn their wages.

Moroni 5:160
 160 And it came to pass that they did find food upon the
face of the earth; and thus they did find themselves on the
wilderness, and began to be a delightsome people.

Moroni 5:161
 161 And it came to pass that they did make tools of wood
and of copper, and smith all manner of machinery.

Moroni 5:162
 162 And they were a delightsome people, full of gold and
silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of precious
things, and did diligently guard their mines and their
precious things, and also their herds, and their flocks of
animals, and their herds of all manner of cattle, and
all manner of fruit, and of grain.

Moroni 5:163
 163 And these are the words of Zoram, who was the high priest
and a high priest over the people of the Lord, who
gave the record and the commandments unto the children of men
on the east and on the west, who were the children of the
household of Jacob.

Moroni 5:164
 164 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he
should prepare a record of the earth, of the creation of the
earth, and of the creation of the heavens, and of the earth
and of the earth, which shall be a record of the whole creation; and
it shall also be a record of all the great and
terrible doings of my people, from the days of Adam down to
the days of our records.

Moroni 5:165
 165 And it shall also be a record of my righteous
servants, from the days of Adam down to the days of our
records.

Moroni 5:166
 166 And behold, I have caused that the words of Zoram
should be written, forth; and he
caused the people to gather together their things and
their seeds, and journey forth into the wilderness.

Moroni 5:158
 158 And thus they did find themselves in the borders of the land
Desolation, and also in the borders of the land, which
had been desolate since the days of man.

Moroni 5:159
 159 And they did establish cities, and villages, and the
people came forth into the wilderness, and began to
earn their wages.

Moroni 5:160
 160 And it came to pass that they did find food upon the
face of the earth; and thus they did find themselves on the
wilderness, and began to be a delightsome people.

Moroni 5:161
 161 And it came to pass that they did make tools of wood
and of copper, and smith all manner of machinery.

Moroni 5:162
 162 And they were a delightsome people, full of gold and
silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of precious
things, and did diligently guard their mines and their
precious things, and also their herds, and their flocks of
animals, and their herds of all manner of cattle, and
all manner of fruit, and of grain.

Moroni 5:163
 163 And these are the words of Zoram, who was the high priest
and a high priest over the people of the Lord, who
gave the record and the commandments unto the children of men
on the east and on the west, who were the children of the
household of Jacob.

Moroni 5:164
 164 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he
should prepare a record of the earth, of the creation of the
earth, and of the creation of the heavens, and of the earth
and of the earth, which shall be a record of the whole creation; and
it shall also be a record of all the great and
terrible doings of my people, from the days of Adam down to
the days of our records.

Moroni 5:165
 165 And it shall also be a record of my righteous
servants, from the days of Adam down to the days of our
records.

Moroni 5:166
 166 And behold, I have caused that the words of Zoram
should be written, which are written by the servants of
my father.

Moroni 5:167
 167 And it came to pass that after the Lord had made
these records, he caused that they should be hid in a manner
that they should not be made known unto the people, until they
should go forth unto the world, and be translated by the power
of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 5:168
 168 Now there are two thousand and three years from the
coming of Christ to the coming of Christ the twelve apostles
of the Lamb, and they are not yet come; neither are they
yet taught in all things whatsoever concerning them.

Moroni 5:169
 169 But they are about to be gathered together in the
cloud, and shall be brought forth upon the morrow.

Moroni 5:170
 170 And after they have been brought forth upon the morrow, and
after the record which has been engraven upon the plates of
brass on the anvil of the Lord hath been made known unto them,
yea, then cometh the Son of righteousness.

Moroni 5:171
 171 And thus I do cause that they should be read, for they are
preserved.

Moroni 5:172
 172 For there are records which are engraven upon the plates
of brass, which cannot be hid; and also there are records which
are engraven upon the plates of brass which cannot be hid.

Moroni 5:173
 173 But behold, these are preserved, and they are kept and
preserved, and they are made known by the power of the Holy
Ghost; therefore they are made known unto all those who are
read, not only in the land of Zarahemla, but also in the land
Desolation, and also in the land of Nephi, as well as in
the land of Mosiah.

Moroni 5:174
 174 And now I carefully review the record which is written
by the Jews, which records the prophets from the days of
their captivity down to the days of Mosiah.

Moroni 5:175
 175 And now, if these things are not made known unto the
children of men, behold, I would that ye should know, that whatsoever
things have been spoken by these Jews have
been written by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 5ch are written by the servants of
my father.

Moroni 5:167
 167 And it came to pass that after the Lord had made
these records, he caused that they should be hid in a manner
that they should not be made known unto the people, until they
should go forth unto the world, and be translated by the power
of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 5:168
 168 Now there are two thousand and three years from the
coming of Christ to the coming of Christ the twelve apostles
of the Lamb, and they are not yet come; neither are they
yet taught in all things whatsoever concerning them.

Moroni 5:169
 169 But they are about to be gathered together in the
cloud, and shall be brought forth upon the morrow.

Moroni 5:170
 170 And after they have been brought forth upon the morrow, and
after the record which has been engraven upon the plates of
brass on the anvil of the Lord hath been made known unto them,
yea, then cometh the Son of righteousness.

Moroni 5:171
 171 And thus I do cause that they should be read, for they are
preserved.

Moroni 5:172
 172 For there are records which are engraven upon the plates
of brass, which cannot be hid; and also there are records which
are engraven upon the plates of brass which cannot be hid.

Moroni 5:173
 173 But behold, these are preserved, and they are kept and
preserved, and they are made known by the power of the Holy
Ghost; therefore they are made known unto all those who are
read, not only in the land of Zarahemla, but also in the land
Desolation, and also in the land of Nephi, as well as in
the land of Mosiah.

Moroni 5:174
 174 And now I carefully review the record which is written
by the Jews, which records the prophets from the days of
their captivity down to the days of Mosiah.

Moroni 5:175
 175 And now, if these things are not made known unto the
children of men, behold, I would that ye should know, that whatsoever
things have been spoken by these Jews have
been written by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 5:176
 176 And now it came to pass that in the latter end of the
thirtieth year, Moroni sent a proclamation throughout all the
land among all the people who were desirous to be baptized,
wanting to know of all the churches which believed in Christ, to
be baptized.

Moroni 5:177
 177 And it came to pass that they all testified, saying:

Moroni 5:178
 178 We believe in Christ; therefore, we believe in baptism.

Moroni 5:179
 179 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the people
witness the things which they had heard and seen, in order that
they might believe on the Lord.

Moroni 5:180
 180 Therefore, they were baptized in the name of Christ.

Moroni 5:181
 181 And it came to pass that there were two hundred years
between the time that the people were in bondage, and the time
that Christ appeared unto the people.

Moroni 5:182
 182 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the people who
had been taken in at the time of the waters should be cast into
the sea; but behold, they were not drunk at the time they were
taken in the water; therefore they did swim in the waters for the
space of two hundred and two years.

Moroni 5:183
 183 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that all the
people should be baptized, yea, even all the children of men,
save it were those who had not believed in the fulness of
the gospel; for they were not baptized because they supposed that
they were without the law; therefore, they were without the law.

Moroni 5:184
 184 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that those who
had been taken in at the time of the waters should be cast into the
sea; and they were not found by the coast, save they had
swallowed up the law; therefore, it was broken and the Lord
preserved them.

Moroni 5:185
 185 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the
people should take up arms against the people of Nephi, and also
all the people who were in the land round about, and
overthrow the land, and destroy the land, and cause a
wickedness among all the land; and they were that in the latter end of the
thirtieth year, Moroni sent a proclamation throughout all the
land among all the people who were desirous to be baptized,
wanting to know of all the churches which believed in Christ, to
be baptized.

Moroni 5:177
 177 And it came to pass that they all testified, saying:

Moroni 5:178
 178 We believe in Christ; therefore, we believe in baptism.

Moroni 5:179
 179 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the people
witness the things which they had heard and seen, in order that
they might believe on the Lord.

Moroni 5:180
 180 Therefore, they were baptized in the name of Christ.

Moroni 5:181
 181 And it came to pass that there were two hundred years
between the time that the people were in bondage, and the time
that Christ appeared unto the people.

Moroni 5:182
 182 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the people who
had been taken in at the time of the waters should be cast into
the sea; but behold, they were not drunk at the time they were
taken in the water; therefore they did swim in the waters for the
space of two hundred and two years.

Moroni 5:183
 183 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that all the
people should be baptized, yea, even all the children of men,
save it were those who had not believed in the fulness of
the gospel; for they were not baptized because they supposed that
they were without the law; therefore, they were without the law.

Moroni 5:184
 184 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that those who
had been taken in at the time of the waters should be cast into the
sea; and they were not found by the coast, save they had
swallowed up the law; therefore, it was broken and the Lord
preserved them.

Moroni 5:185
 185 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the
people should take up arms against the people of Nephi, and also
all the people who were in the land round about, and
overthrow the land, and destroy the land, and cause a
wickedness among all the land; and they were not numbered
among the people of Nephi.

Moroni 5:186
 186 And it came to pass that the people did make preparations to
depart into the land.

Moroni 5:187
 187 And it came to pass that Moroni had sealed up all the
records which had been kept by the people concerning
the destruction of their people.

Moroni 5:188
 188 And it came to pass that they sailed up into the waters
northward.

Moroni 5:189
 189 And they arrived at the land of Zarahemla, and began
to build a ship.

Moroni 5:190
 190 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the
people should be gathered together in one body, as it
was in the land of Zarahemla, to sail up into the land of
Zarahemla; and he also caused that all those who
were in the land of the lake should stand forth at the
head thereof to read the records which had been kept
by the people.

Moroni 5:191
 191 And it came to pass that when the people of Zarahemla
had all read the records which had been kept by the
people of Nephi, they were desirous to know the cause of
their ignorance.

Moroni 5:192
 192 And it came to pass that they did search the records,
and behold they had been hid up by the people, that they
might not be discovered; therefore, they did search and
discern that which was hid up by the people, and it was
repentance.

Moroni 5:193
 193 And it came to pass that all those who were in the land
of the lake were desirous to know the cause of their
illness.

Moroni 5:194
 194 And it came to pass that Moroni said unto them: Behold, it is the
interest of this man to know the cause of this people's
illnesses, that he might know concerning the restoration of
men down upon the face of the earth; therefore, he shall read
them.

Moroni 5:195
 195 But behold, the Lord hath commanded him that he
should not read the records which had been kept up by
his people; therefore, he read them not.

Moroni 5:196
 196 But it came to pass thatcause a
wickedness among all the land; and they were not numbered
among the people of Nephi.

Moroni 5:186
 186 And it came to pass that the people did make preparations to
depart into the land.

Moroni 5:187
 187 And it came to pass that Moroni had sealed up all the
records which had been kept by the people concerning
the destruction of their people.

Moroni 5:188
 188 And it came to pass that they sailed up into the waters
northward.

Moroni 5:189
 189 And they arrived at the land of Zarahemla, and began
to build a ship.

Moroni 5:190
 190 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the
people should be gathered together in one body, as it
was in the land of Zarahemla, to sail up into the land of
Zarahemla; and he also caused that all those who
were in the land of the lake should stand forth at the
head thereof to read the records which had been kept
by the people.

Moroni 5:191
 191 And it came to pass that when the people of Zarahemla
had all read the records which had been kept by the
people of Nephi, they were desirous to know the cause of
their ignorance.

Moroni 5:192
 192 And it came to pass that they did search the records,
and behold they had been hid up by the people, that they
might not be discovered; therefore, they did search and
discern that which was hid up by the people, and it was
repentance.

Moroni 5:193
 193 And it came to pass that all those who were in the land
of the lake were desirous to know the cause of their
illness.

Moroni 5:194
 194 And it came to pass that Moroni said unto them: Behold, it is the
interest of this man to know the cause of this people's
illnesses, that he might know concerning the restoration of
men down upon the face of the earth; therefore, he shall read
them.

Moroni 5:195
 195 But behold, the Lord hath commanded him that he
should not read the records which had been kept up by
his people; therefore, he read them not.

Moroni 5:196
 196 But it came to pass that he read the last records,
and they were delivered unto him by the Spirit of the Lord.

Moroni 5:197
 197 And he read them, and said unto them: Behold, I know that
the records which have been kept up by my people, which
have been delivered unto me by the Spirit of the Lord, are
sufficient to restore men to their former condition upon
the face of the earth; for behold, only a few of them have
witnessed unto me that they have been delivered unto me by the Spirit of
the Lord, and they testify that they are preserved by the power of
the Spirit, that they are delivered out of the hands of those who
have been wounded for our sins.

Moroni 5:198
 198 But behold, I know that the greater part of them have
performed other works, even as they have suffered, because of the
flesh and blood of their people; for they have not repented of the
things which they have done, neither have they repented of the things
which they have not done.

Moroni 5:199
 199 Nevertheless, they have suffered in the things which they have
done, for they have suffered the will of God upon them, and
they have suffered the hatred and the contempt of their people,
even until this day.

Moroni 5:200
 200 And they have suffered justly, for they have not repented
of the things which they have not done.

Moroni 5:201
 201 And they are not ashamed, neither are they slow to remember,
neither are they unsearchable; therefore they do remember the things which
they have not done, and they do remember the things which they have
not done.

Moroni 5:202
 202 And it is these things which make them hard; for as the
latter have they done in the bodies of their children; so in the
nowing they shall do in the end, for they are delivered from the
hand of that which they have not done.

Moroni 5:203
 203 Therefore, Moroni, I command thee, Moroni, that thou shalt
see that these things are done, and that they shall be kept
up by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the lesser
part of this peoplehe last records,
and they were delivered unto him by the Spirit of the Lord.

Moroni 5:197
 197 And he read them, and said unto them: Behold, I know that
the records which have been kept up by my people, which
have been delivered unto me by the Spirit of the Lord, are
sufficient to restore men to their former condition upon
the face of the earth; for behold, only a few of them have
witnessed unto me that they have been delivered unto me by the Spirit of
the Lord, and they testify that they are preserved by the power of
the Spirit, that they are delivered out of the hands of those who
have been wounded for our sins.

Moroni 5:198
 198 But behold, I know that the greater part of them have
performed other works, even as they have suffered, because of the
flesh and blood of their people; for they have not repented of the
things which they have done, neither have they repented of the things
which they have not done.

Moroni 5:199
 199 Nevertheless, they have suffered in the things which they have
done, for they have suffered the will of God upon them, and
they have suffered the hatred and the contempt of their people,
even until this day.

Moroni 5:200
 200 And they have suffered justly, for they have not repented
of the things which they have not done.

Moroni 5:201
 201 And they are not ashamed, neither are they slow to remember,
neither are they unsearchable; therefore they do remember the things which
they have not done, and they do remember the things which they have
not done.

Moroni 5:202
 202 And it is these things which make them hard; for as the
latter have they done in the bodies of their children; so in the
nowing they shall do in the end, for they are delivered from the
hand of that which they have not done.

Moroni 5:203
 203 Therefore, Moroni, I command thee, Moroni, that thou shalt
see that these things are done, and that they shall be kept
up by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the lesser
part of this people may know concerning the things which they
have not done, and know also concerning the things which they
have done;

Moroni 5:204
 204 That they have suffered the hatred of their enemies, and
suffered the contempt of their people, and
witnessed with their hands the things which they have not
done, and hearkened unto the words of their fathers.

Moroni 5:205
 205 And now I desire with a firmness of soul that this my
people, the Nephites, may know concerning these things;
wherefore, if I have no authority for this thing, judge ye; for
I am commanded of the Lord.

Moroni 5:206
 206 But I will tell you that I know of myself that I have
performed this thing unto my people, the Nephites. Behold, I have
performed it unto my people, the Jews; for I have truly repented
of the things which I had not done, and sought of the Lord the
alligator which had swallowed me up.

Moroni 5:207
 207 And now, I would tell you, Moroni, that if my people, the
Nephites, had known these things, they would not have repented,
neither would have taken the Jews to task for the things which
they had not done.

Moroni 5:208
 208 But behold, they knew not our Lord, therefore they have repented
of us in the things which we have not done.

Moroni 5:209
 209 And they also know that it is by the grace of God, and the
power of the Holy Ghost that we have been saved in the
things which we have not done--for this cause, that it was by
the grace of God that we were saved from falling into the pit.

Moroni 5:210
 210 And now behold, if they had known these things, and had believed
in the more parts of the gospel which was given unto them, they
would have remained in that state of ignorance, which hath been
performed by those who were not acquainted with the
gospel, until the last, for they sought to destroy the
things of the gospel. But behold, we have repented in the
gospel; and the Lord hath given us the cure, according to our
rejoicings.

Moroni 5:211
 211 And the Lord said unto Joseph: Behold, I will cure you,
and I will visit you in myhey
have not done, and know also concerning the things which they
have done;

Moroni 5:204
 204 That they have suffered the hatred of their enemies, and
suffered the contempt of their people, and
witnessed with their hands the things which they have not
done, and hearkened unto the words of their fathers.

Moroni 5:205
 205 And now I desire with a firmness of soul that this my
people, the Nephites, may know concerning these things;
wherefore, if I have no authority for this thing, judge ye; for
I am commanded of the Lord.

Moroni 5:206
 206 But I will tell you that I know of myself that I have
performed this thing unto my people, the Nephites. Behold, I have
performed it unto my people, the Jews; for I have truly repented
of the things which I had not done, and sought of the Lord the
alligator which had swallowed me up.

Moroni 5:207
 207 And now, I would tell you, Moroni, that if my people, the
Nephites, had known these things, they would not have repented,
neither would have taken the Jews to task for the things which
they had not done.

Moroni 5:208
 208 But behold, they knew not our Lord, therefore they have repented
of us in the things which we have not done.

Moroni 5:209
 209 And they also know that it is by the grace of God, and the
power of the Holy Ghost that we have been saved in the
things which we have not done--for this cause, that it was by
the grace of God that we were saved from falling into the pit.

Moroni 5:210
 210 And now behold, if they had known these things, and had believed
in the more parts of the gospel which was given unto them, they
would have remained in that state of ignorance, which hath been
performed by those who were not acquainted with the
gospel, until the last, for they sought to destroy the
things of the gospel. But behold, we have repented in the
gospel; and the Lord hath given us the cure, according to our
rejoicings.

Moroni 5:211
 211 And the Lord said unto Joseph: Behold, I will cure you,
and I will visit you in my name in the days of mine
death; therefore, go forth and say unto this people--Repent ye,
for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of the
Father; for except ye repent we shall be cut off from the presence
of the Father.

Moroni 5:212
 212 And now, my son Joseph, I say unto you that except ye repent
of all your sins, and deny the Holy Ghost, and deny the
Father, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of the Father,
if ye will hearken unto my words.

Moroni 5:213
 213 But behold, I say unto you, Joseph, that even if ye will deny
the Holy Ghost, and deny the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, and will not ask the Father in the name of him that hath
given you the Holy Ghost, behold, I will show unto you that ye are
not worthy of the kingdom of the Father.

Moroni 5:214
 214 Behold, I am he that denyeth the Holy Ghost; and I request of
thee that ye would say no more, for I am he that is not
worthy. If I were to be cast out of the presence of the Father,
if I were to deny the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost would
be given unto me according to my desire.

Moroni 5:215
 215 But behold, I will show unto you that it is by the
grace of God that I am brought back into the presence of the Father,
that I have not sought to destroy the scriptures of my fathers,
but I have made them known unto you that I know them to be true.

Moroni 5:216
 216 And now, behold, I do not desire that ye should suppose that I
know these things to be certain; but behold, I am persuaded that
they are true.

Moroni 5:217
 217 For there is a God, and he hath created all things both
things which are in heaven and in earth; yea, and all things
which are in the earth, and all things which are in the water
which is round about the earth.

Moroni 5:218
 218 And now, all things which are in the water, and
whither they travel, all things whichhe Lord said unto Joseph: Behold, I will cure you,
and I will visit you in my name in the days of mine
death; therefore, go forth and say unto this people--Repent ye,
for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of the
Father; for except ye repent we shall be cut off from the presence
of the Father.

Moroni 5:212
 212 And now, my son Joseph, I say unto you that except ye repent
of all your sins, and deny the Holy Ghost, and deny the
Father, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of the Father,
if ye will hearken unto my words.

Moroni 5:213
 213 But behold, I say unto you, Joseph, that even if ye will deny
the Holy Ghost, and deny the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, and will not ask the Father in the name of him that hath
given you the Holy Ghost, behold, I will show unto you that ye are
not worthy of the kingdom of the Father.

Moroni 5:214
 214 Behold, I am he that denyeth the Holy Ghost; and I request of
thee that ye would say no more, for I am he that is not
worthy. If I were to be cast out of the presence of the Father,
if I were to deny the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost would
be given unto me according to my desire.

Moroni 5:215
 215 But behold, I will show unto you that it is by the
grace of God that I am brought back into the presence of the Father,
that I have not sought to destroy the scriptures of my fathers,
but I have made them known unto you that I know them to be true.

Moroni 5:216
 216 And now, behold, I do not desire that ye should suppose that I
know these things to be certain; but behold, I am persuaded that
they are true.

Moroni 5:217
 217 For there is a God, and he hath created all things both
things which are in heaven and in earth; yea, and all things
which are in the earth, and all things which are in the water
which is round about the earth.

Moroni 5:218
 218 And now, all things which are in the water, and
whither they travel, all things which are in the air, and
all things which are in the waters, and they are ordained of
the Father according to the operation of the Father in
manifesting his will through the Son, that thereby man
could not be saved.

Moroni 5:219
 219 Therefore, all things which are in the air, and which
are moved by the Father, are of the Father; therefore they are
of the Son.

Moroni 5:220
 220 Now this is the doctrine of the Father. When ye shall receive
this say ye shall know that I know the Father and the Son;
therefore ye shall know that thou art with me in the Father.

Moroni 5:221
 221 Therefore I say unto you, go forth and deny not the Holy
Ghost. Hearken unto me, and believe in my words; pray unto the
Father in the name of the Son, that he send his Beloved into the
fatherland, that they may bring forth fruit meet for repentance;
at the last day they might be brought back into the presence of the
Father.

Moroni 5:222
 222 Therefore I say unto you, Go, for ye shall know that when the
Father cometh upon you the resistance will be like unto the
heavens; for the light of the Father hath no light upon you, but the
Father hath all power upon you, and also upon your parents.

Moroni 5:223
 223 Therefore, when ye shall receive this say ye shall know that the
Father hath all power, and also the Son; and the Father, because thou
art in the church, hath all power, according to his word which he hath
commanded.

Moroni 5:224
 224 And now, if the Father hath commanded me to write these
things I would have written them. But, behold, the Father
commanded me that I should write them; therefore I write them.

Moroni 5:225
 225 But, behold, this I do not write because the Father hath
commanded me to write them; neither will the Father command me that
I should write them; but they are hid up, for they are
rejected by me.

Moroni 5:226
 226 Therefore I write them that the light of the world may be
diluted in them; for behold, the world hath seen them,nd
all things which are in the waters, and they are ordained of
the Father according to the operation of the Father in
manifesting his will through the Son, that thereby man
could not be saved.

Moroni 5:219
 219 Therefore, all things which are in the air, and which
are moved by the Father, are of the Father; therefore they are
of the Son.

Moroni 5:220
 220 Now this is the doctrine of the Father. When ye shall receive
this say ye shall know that I know the Father and the Son;
therefore ye shall know that thou art with me in the Father.

Moroni 5:221
 221 Therefore I say unto you, go forth and deny not the Holy
Ghost. Hearken unto me, and believe in my words; pray unto the
Father in the name of the Son, that he send his Beloved into the
fatherland, that they may bring forth fruit meet for repentance;
at the last day they might be brought back into the presence of the
Father.

Moroni 5:222
 222 Therefore I say unto you, Go, for ye shall know that when the
Father cometh upon you the resistance will be like unto the
heavens; for the light of the Father hath no light upon you, but the
Father hath all power upon you, and also upon your parents.

Moroni 5:223
 223 Therefore, when ye shall receive this say ye shall know that the
Father hath all power, and also the Son; and the Father, because thou
art in the church, hath all power, according to his word which he hath
commanded.

Moroni 5:224
 224 And now, if the Father hath commanded me to write these
things I would have written them. But, behold, the Father
commanded me that I should write them; therefore I write them.

Moroni 5:225
 225 But, behold, this I do not write because the Father hath
commanded me to write them; neither will the Father command me that
I should write them; but they are hid up, for they are
rejected by me.

Moroni 5:226
 226 Therefore I write them that the light of the world may be
diluted in them; for behold, the world hath seen them, and they
are known unto the children of men.

Moroni 5:227
 227 But it mattereth not if they be hid up, for the
Father knoweth the things of its own accord; therefore I write
them not because of mine ignorance.

Moroni 5:228
 228 Nevertheless, the Father hath commanded me that I should write
them; for he remembereth the covenant which he hath made
unto the children of men, and he remembereth his covenants
with the children of men; therefore I write them.

Moroni 5:229
 229 And it came to pass that when I, Moroni, had received this
commandment I looked upon the records which had been hid up
from the time that the world began, and I beheld that the
Lord had commanded Abraham to bring forth his seed.

Moroni 5:230
 230 And I also beheld that the Lord hath commanded the sons of
Israel to make
preserved according to the voice of the Lord; therefore I beheld,
concerning the things of which I should write the things
of my father had told me, that I should write these things
after this manner.

Moroni 5:231
 231 And I read unto my father the records which were hid up
from the time that the world began, and beheld that the
Lord hath commanded me to write them; and also all his holy
commands which he hath bestowed upon us.

Moroni 5:232
 232 And it came to pass that I beheld that the Lord hath
commanded me to write these things according to the voice of the
Lord; and also all his holy commandments.

Moroni 5:233
 233 And I prayed unto the Lord that he would cause that he should
according to his voice be fulfilled.

Moroni 5:234
 234 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Go, and tell
the people of the remnant of the seed of Joseph whom my
father saw;

Moroni 5:235
 235 And I have beheld that they have written them; and I will
show them in mine own due time.

Moroni 5:236
 236 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did go and make
preserved according to the voice of the Lord; and I showed them
the plates of Nephi, which contained the genealogy of my
father.
he children of men.

Moroni 5:227
 227 But it mattereth not if they be hid up, for the
Father knoweth the things of its own accord; therefore I write
them not because of mine ignorance.

Moroni 5:228
 228 Nevertheless, the Father hath commanded me that I should write
them; for he remembereth the covenant which he hath made
unto the children of men, and he remembereth his covenants
with the children of men; therefore I write them.

Moroni 5:229
 229 And it came to pass that when I, Moroni, had received this
commandment I looked upon the records which had been hid up
from the time that the world began, and I beheld that the
Lord had commanded Abraham to bring forth his seed.

Moroni 5:230
 230 And I also beheld that the Lord hath commanded the sons of
Israel to make
preserved according to the voice of the Lord; therefore I beheld,
concerning the things of which I should write the things
of my father had told me, that I should write these things
after this manner.

Moroni 5:231
 231 And I read unto my father the records which were hid up
from the time that the world began, and beheld that the
Lord hath commanded me to write them; and also all his holy
commands which he hath bestowed upon us.

Moroni 5:232
 232 And it came to pass that I beheld that the Lord hath
commanded me to write these things according to the voice of the
Lord; and also all his holy commandments.

Moroni 5:233
 233 And I prayed unto the Lord that he would cause that he should
according to his voice be fulfilled.

Moroni 5:234
 234 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Go, and tell
the people of the remnant of the seed of Joseph whom my
father saw;

Moroni 5:235
 235 And I have beheld that they have written them; and I will
show them in mine own due time.

Moroni 5:236
 236 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did go and make
preserved according to the voice of the Lord; and I showed them
the plates of Nephi, which contained the genealogy of my
father.

Moroni 5:237
 237 And it came to pass that they were desirous to know of
me, even if it were possible that I could write the things
of my father.

Moroni 5:238
 238 But I said unto them: Behold, thou hast commanded me
that I should write them; and the Lord hath commanded me that
I should write them.

Moroni 5:239
 239 And it came to pass that I did write them; and the Lord
hath commanded me that I should seal up the remainder of the
record which I have been writing.

Moroni 5:240
 240 And it came to pass that when my father, Lehi, had heard
these words he was filled with the Spirit.

Moroni 5:241
 241 And it came to pass that he went forth and wrote the
things which he had written.

Moroni 5:242
 242 And it came to pass that he wrote them in the book of
record.

Moroni 5:243
 243 And it came to pass that he wrote the things which he had
written in the book of record, and sealed them up; and he
departed thence.

Moroni 5:244
 244 And it came to pass that I beheld the days of the Messiah,
and also also the fulfillment of the prophecies which had been spoken by
the prophets.

Moroni 5:245
 245 And I, Moroni, beheld the Messiah, and he was about to
come among the people; but he was hindered by the voice of the
Lord; therefore he did not proceed with his words.

Moroni 5:246
 246 And I beheld the earth, and the walls of the city of
Jerusalem; and he that dwelleth therein shall be judged of
him that dwelleth in the earth.

Moroni 5:247
 247 Behold, I was about to write in the book of record the
death-toll of the saints; but behold, the Lord hath
commanded me that I should not write the things which had
been done among the people of Israel; and he also hath commanded
me that I should not write the things which had been done in
the land of Zarahemla; and he also hath commanded me that I
should not write the things which had been done in thephi, which contained the genealogy of my
father.

Moroni 5:237
 237 And it came to pass that they were desirous to know of
me, even if it were possible that I could write the things
of my father.

Moroni 5:238
 238 But I said unto them: Behold, thou hast commanded me
that I should write them; and the Lord hath commanded me that
I should write them.

Moroni 5:239
 239 And it came to pass that I did write them; and the Lord
hath commanded me that I should seal up the remainder of the
record which I have been writing.

Moroni 5:240
 240 And it came to pass that when my father, Lehi, had heard
these words he was filled with the Spirit.

Moroni 5:241
 241 And it came to pass that he went forth and wrote the
things which he had written.

Moroni 5:242
 242 And it came to pass that he wrote them in the book of
record.

Moroni 5:243
 243 And it came to pass that he wrote the things which he had
written in the book of record, and sealed them up; and he
departed thence.

Moroni 5:244
 244 And it came to pass that I beheld the days of the Messiah,
and also also the fulfillment of the prophecies which had been spoken by
the prophets.

Moroni 5:245
 245 And I, Moroni, beheld the Messiah, and he was about to
come among the people; but he was hindered by the voice of the
Lord; therefore he did not proceed with his words.

Moroni 5:246
 246 And I beheld the earth, and the walls of the city of
Jerusalem; and he that dwelleth therein shall be judged of
him that dwelleth in the earth.

Moroni 5:247
 247 Behold, I was about to write in the book of record the
death-toll of the saints; but behold, the Lord hath
commanded me that I should not write the things which had
been done among the people of Israel; and he also hath commanded
me that I should not write the things which had been done in
the land of Zarahemla; and he also hath commanded me that I
should not write the things which had been done in the land
of Qana; for he being a righteous man did not kill the
wicked because they belonged to his church.

Moroni 5:248
 248 Yea, he being a righteous man did not take the life of the
wicked because they belonged to his church; but he did not spare the
wicked because of the things which he had done unto them; but he
spared not the wicked because of the things which he had
done unto them.

Moroni 5:249
 249 And now I do not write the things which are written,
for our records are not large. But behold, I have
written the things which have been written, and sealed up the
records of my father; and I do this because it is the
law of the Lord that we keep his commandments.

Moroni 5:250
 250 And it came to pass that I wrote these things that
my father might know concerning the things which he spake.

Moroni 5:251
 251 And I would that he should seal up the records, and
preserve them up, that he might write nothing which hath
been written save it were the things which he had seen and
heard; for he truly saw many things, and he wrote them down
for others.

Moroni 5:252
 252 And it came to pass that he died, and I beheld my
father, that he had written the records which had been
sealed up, for which purpose he had died.

Moroni 5:253
 253 And now, I, Moroni, write a few of the things which have
been written by my father, which he hath recorded
concerning his travels in the wilderness;

Moroni 5:254
 254 And also a few of his words he hath written down for the
benefit of future generations.

Moroni 5:255
 255 And now, I finish my record concerning my father; for he has
written many things which he saw and heard.

Moroni 5:256
 256 And I will give an account of all his words and
his words alone.

Moroni 5:257
 257 For it came to pass that after my father had made
an abridgment from the plates of brass to the
memory of his father, he desired that his
brother Nephi should make an accountn the land
of Qana; for he being a righteous man did not kill the
wicked because they belonged to his church.

Moroni 5:248
 248 Yea, he being a righteous man did not take the life of the
wicked because they belonged to his church; but he did not spare the
wicked because of the things which he had done unto them; but he
spared not the wicked because of the things which he had
done unto them.

Moroni 5:249
 249 And now I do not write the things which are written,
for our records are not large. But behold, I have
written the things which have been written, and sealed up the
records of my father; and I do this because it is the
law of the Lord that we keep his commandments.

Moroni 5:250
 250 And it came to pass that I wrote these things that
my father might know concerning the things which he spake.

Moroni 5:251
 251 And I would that he should seal up the records, and
preserve them up, that he might write nothing which hath
been written save it were the things which he had seen and
heard; for he truly saw many things, and he wrote them down
for others.

Moroni 5:252
 252 And it came to pass that he died, and I beheld my
father, that he had written the records which had been
sealed up, for which purpose he had died.

Moroni 5:253
 253 And now, I, Moroni, write a few of the things which have
been written by my father, which he hath recorded
concerning his travels in the wilderness;

Moroni 5:254
 254 And also a few of his words he hath written down for the
benefit of future generations.

Moroni 5:255
 255 And now, I finish my record concerning my father; for he has
written many things which he saw and heard.

Moroni 5:256
 256 And I will give an account of all his words and
his words alone.

Moroni 5:257
 257 For it came to pass that after my father had made
an abridgment from the plates of brass to the
memory of his father, he desired that his
brother Nephi should make an account of the things which he had
seen.

Moroni 5:258
 258 Now I am desirous to see the plates of brass, that I may
see them, and hear them, and know of the prophecies which
saith concerning them; for behold, they are hid up in the
earth; but I cannot find them; for they have been taken from
the earth. But behold, I am come that I may find them; and I
am desirous to inquire of them, that I may know of the
praises which are to come.

Moroni 5:259
 259 But it came to pass that when my father had made an
abridgment from the plates of brass to the memory of
his father, he thought it was not expedient that he should be
disposed of as yet, for he was desirous to learn concerning
the plates of brass, for he beheld that they contained
exceedingly many things which he desired to learn.

Moroni 5:260
 260 And it came to pass that he sent for his brother, who was
the father of Nephi, and desired that he should come in unto the
father, to be his clerk. But he being a man of cold and a
man of impenetrable speech, therefore his brother could not come in
unto the father.

Moroni 5:261
 261 And it came to pass that they sent a message to the
father, that he should return unto them in the valley of
Mulek, and that he should take of the fruit of the tree of
the sapphirah, which was in the fruit-tree, and drink of the
apple thereof, that he would not thirst; and he would suffer
that his children might not partake of it, that he himself
might not partake of the evil one.

Moroni 5:262
 262 And it came to pass that the father of Nephi did not return
unto his own house. And while he was thus journeying
thither, behold, Ammon and also his brethren were
visited by the Spirit; and they saw him coming in unto
the father, with a canary, through the cleft of the earth.

Moroni 5:263
 263 And it came to pass that he said unto them:
Brothers, I know that thou wilt not go forth unto the
father to learn concerning these thingse things which he had
seen.

Moroni 5:258
 258 Now I am desirous to see the plates of brass, that I may
see them, and hear them, and know of the prophecies which
saith concerning them; for behold, they are hid up in the
earth; but I cannot find them; for they have been taken from
the earth. But behold, I am come that I may find them; and I
am desirous to inquire of them, that I may know of the
praises which are to come.

Moroni 5:259
 259 But it came to pass that when my father had made an
abridgment from the plates of brass to the memory of
his father, he thought it was not expedient that he should be
disposed of as yet, for he was desirous to learn concerning
the plates of brass, for he beheld that they contained
exceedingly many things which he desired to learn.

Moroni 5:260
 260 And it came to pass that he sent for his brother, who was
the father of Nephi, and desired that he should come in unto the
father, to be his clerk. But he being a man of cold and a
man of impenetrable speech, therefore his brother could not come in
unto the father.

Moroni 5:261
 261 And it came to pass that they sent a message to the
father, that he should return unto them in the valley of
Mulek, and that he should take of the fruit of the tree of
the sapphirah, which was in the fruit-tree, and drink of the
apple thereof, that he would not thirst; and he would suffer
that his children might not partake of it, that he himself
might not partake of the evil one.

Moroni 5:262
 262 And it came to pass that the father of Nephi did not return
unto his own house. And while he was thus journeying
thither, behold, Ammon and also his brethren were
visited by the Spirit; and they saw him coming in unto
the father, with a canary, through the cleft of the earth.

Moroni 5:263
 263 And it came to pass that he said unto them:
Brothers, I know that thou wilt not go forth unto the
father to learn concerning these things; for behold, I have had
exceedingly much commandment from the Father that these
things should be hid up in the earth, that I may know of the
things which thou hast desired.

Moroni 5:264
 264 And now, behold, I know that thou wilt not quench this
commandment; for thou shalt not suffer the children of men
to know concerning this thing.

Moroni 5:265
 265 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I know that thou wilt,
by thy words, cause that they shall be kept up in the
earth, that they may know of the things which the Father
commands them, that they may know concerning the things which
they must shortly come to pass according to the words which he
has spoken unto us.

Moroni 5:266
 266 Therefore, I command thee that thou shalt not suffer my
children to drink the tree of the sapphirah which is in the
fruit-tree; for behold, I will suffer them not.

Moroni 5:267
 267 And it shall come to pass in that day, that they shall
know that I have vowed unto them, that I will remember my
covenant which I have made with them, which was with God I
am, and my children, and my kindred and friends; and they
are they who are willing to take upon them the name of my
God; therefore, I know that they will be saved.

Moroni 5:268
 268 Behold, I am sent unto my father, Moroni, as a
dispute arose among my people concerning the
names of the children of men hereafter to inherit the land of
Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:269
 269 Behold, I am a man of many words; yet I well knew the
intent of my father, that I should speak many things unto my
father upon this wise, which he should understand.

Moroni 5:270
 270 For he spake many things concerning the destruction of
his people upon the land; yea, and also concerning the
destruction of the people of the city of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:271
 271 And it came to pass that he spake many things unto my
father, which were written unto him, for he had read the
Book of Mormon.

Moroni 5:gs; for behold, I have had
exceedingly much commandment from the Father that these
things should be hid up in the earth, that I may know of the
things which thou hast desired.

Moroni 5:264
 264 And now, behold, I know that thou wilt not quench this
commandment; for thou shalt not suffer the children of men
to know concerning this thing.

Moroni 5:265
 265 Therefore, my beloved brethren, I know that thou wilt,
by thy words, cause that they shall be kept up in the
earth, that they may know of the things which the Father
commands them, that they may know concerning the things which
they must shortly come to pass according to the words which he
has spoken unto us.

Moroni 5:266
 266 Therefore, I command thee that thou shalt not suffer my
children to drink the tree of the sapphirah which is in the
fruit-tree; for behold, I will suffer them not.

Moroni 5:267
 267 And it shall come to pass in that day, that they shall
know that I have vowed unto them, that I will remember my
covenant which I have made with them, which was with God I
am, and my children, and my kindred and friends; and they
are they who are willing to take upon them the name of my
God; therefore, I know that they will be saved.

Moroni 5:268
 268 Behold, I am sent unto my father, Moroni, as a
dispute arose among my people concerning the
names of the children of men hereafter to inherit the land of
Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:269
 269 Behold, I am a man of many words; yet I well knew the
intent of my father, that I should speak many things unto my
father upon this wise, which he should understand.

Moroni 5:270
 270 For he spake many things concerning the destruction of
his people upon the land; yea, and also concerning the
destruction of the people of the city of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:271
 271 And it came to pass that he spake many things unto my
father, which were written unto him, for he had read the
Book of Mormon.

Moroni 5:272
 272 And it came to pass that he spake unto my father,
which were written unto him, for he had heard many things
concerning the destruction of my people upon the land; yea,
there were many revelations given unto him concerning the
destruction of my people upon the land;

Moroni 5:273
 273 And these things he spake because of the hardness of the
hearts of the people of the people of the city of Jerusalem,
at the time when the Lord had appeared unto the people of the
city on the mountain of Mount Sinai.

Moroni 5:274
 274 And it came to pass that he said unto my father,
by saying, Yea, many things have I read, which thou
shouldst not have seen; and many things have I read, which thou
shouldst
not have known.

Moroni 5:275
 275 And it came to pass that he said unto me, Yea, I do know that
thou shouldst not have known; but many things did my father
read which thou shouldst not have known, for he did read the
things which he had read in the books of Moses.

Moroni 5:276
 276 And it came to pass that he did liken the account of the
people of the city of Jerusalem to that of his people who
had been carried captive into Babylon. And he said unto me:
Behold, this will I liken thee to as the people of the city
of Jerusalem before the destruction of the people of that
which had been lost.

Moroni 5:277
 277 And it came to pass that he did liken the account
of the people who had been carried away to the account of the
people of that city who had been carried away into captivity.

Moroni 5:278
 278 And he said unto me: The people in the city of Jerusalem,
as we were once more returned to the land of Jerusalem, were
thrilled with the Lord their God. And the Lord was with them; and
they did rejoice over the dead.

Moroni 5:279
 279 Therefore, when my father saw that the hearts of the
people of the city of Jerusalem were lifted up at the
hands of the people of the land, and they did mourn over the
dead of the city, he spake unto my father, saying:
Inasmuch as ye are desirous tounto my father,
which were written unto him, for he had heard many things
concerning the destruction of my people upon the land; yea,
there were many revelations given unto him concerning the
destruction of my people upon the land;

Moroni 5:273
 273 And these things he spake because of the hardness of the
hearts of the people of the people of the city of Jerusalem,
at the time when the Lord had appeared unto the people of the
city on the mountain of Mount Sinai.

Moroni 5:274
 274 And it came to pass that he said unto my father,
by saying, Yea, many things have I read, which thou
shouldst not have seen; and many things have I read, which thou
shouldst
not have known.

Moroni 5:275
 275 And it came to pass that he said unto me, Yea, I do know that
thou shouldst not have known; but many things did my father
read which thou shouldst not have known, for he did read the
things which he had read in the books of Moses.

Moroni 5:276
 276 And it came to pass that he did liken the account of the
people of the city of Jerusalem to that of his people who
had been carried captive into Babylon. And he said unto me:
Behold, this will I liken thee to as the people of the city
of Jerusalem before the destruction of the people of that
which had been lost.

Moroni 5:277
 277 And it came to pass that he did liken the account
of the people who had been carried away to the account of the
people of that city who had been carried away into captivity.

Moroni 5:278
 278 And he said unto me: The people in the city of Jerusalem,
as we were once more returned to the land of Jerusalem, were
thrilled with the Lord their God. And the Lord was with them; and
they did rejoice over the dead.

Moroni 5:279
 279 Therefore, when my father saw that the hearts of the
people of the city of Jerusalem were lifted up at the
hands of the people of the land, and they did mourn over the
dead of the city, he spake unto my father, saying:
Inasmuch as ye are desirous to return to the land of your
tribulations, being desirous that ye should be judged according to the law
of your fathers, I will declare unto you that the people of the land
are godless, because of the abominations which they have done
unto us.

Moroni 5:280
 280 Therefore, they do not belong to the church of God; for
they have transgressed the laws of the land, and received the
power of the devil that they should do these things.

Moroni 5:281
 281 Therefore, if they can get the law of the land, that
they should do them, the devil will proceed to do away with the
law.

Moroni 5:282
 282 Therefore, if they should transgress the law of the land, as
they have hitherto done, the law will be on their heads; and
thereby they destroy the law of the land; therefore I will
declare unto you, that the law of the land has been on their
heads even from the time they departed out of the land of
Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:283
 283 Therefore, the law hath been on their heads from the time
they departed, and they have transgressed it, and received the
power of the devil that they should do all manner of iniquity.

Moroni 5:284
 284 Yea, I say unto you that the Holy Ghost hath declared it unto
me, even according to the words of the angel of the Lord.

Moroni 5:285
 285 And now, my son, I do not write all the words which I have
spoken unto you, for I have not written them all; but I have
spoken a great many words to the Lord which I did not write, for
the love of my soul I have written them.

Moroni 5:286
 286 But, behold, I have had a dream; and the Lord hath
commanded me that I should write them, that thou mightest
receive them, and that I might not write them again until I should
be weary of them.

Moroni 5:287
 287 And after this manner were the words written--The sinews of
my people which are upon the mountains, and upon the hills, and
upon all the face of this land shall be cut off, and they
shall have no place in the land.

Morirous to return to the land of your
tribulations, being desirous that ye should be judged according to the law
of your fathers, I will declare unto you that the people of the land
are godless, because of the abominations which they have done
unto us.

Moroni 5:280
 280 Therefore, they do not belong to the church of God; for
they have transgressed the laws of the land, and received the
power of the devil that they should do these things.

Moroni 5:281
 281 Therefore, if they can get the law of the land, that
they should do them, the devil will proceed to do away with the
law.

Moroni 5:282
 282 Therefore, if they should transgress the law of the land, as
they have hitherto done, the law will be on their heads; and
thereby they destroy the law of the land; therefore I will
declare unto you, that the law of the land has been on their
heads even from the time they departed out of the land of
Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:283
 283 Therefore, the law hath been on their heads from the time
they departed, and they have transgressed it, and received the
power of the devil that they should do all manner of iniquity.

Moroni 5:284
 284 Yea, I say unto you that the Holy Ghost hath declared it unto
me, even according to the words of the angel of the Lord.

Moroni 5:285
 285 And now, my son, I do not write all the words which I have
spoken unto you, for I have not written them all; but I have
spoken a great many words to the Lord which I did not write, for
the love of my soul I have written them.

Moroni 5:286
 286 But, behold, I have had a dream; and the Lord hath
commanded me that I should write them, that thou mightest
receive them, and that I might not write them again until I should
be weary of them.

Moroni 5:287
 287 And after this manner were the words written--The sinews of
my people which are upon the mountains, and upon the hills, and
upon all the face of this land shall be cut off, and they
shall have no place in the land.

Moroni 5:288
 288 And behold, I am he that wrote them; but he that is
frailed, he that is found repaying the debts of the Lord, he
that is found to be eating and drinking in unrighteousness, he
that is found to be reproving his fathers, he is the Son of
God.

Moroni 5:289
 289 Therefore, all these things which I have written, which
are according to the spirit of prophecy, shall come to pass upon
the remnant of the house of Jacob, which shall be scattered upon
all sides.

Moroni 5:290
 290 For thus saith the Lord: After this that I shall prepare a
return for the house of Jacob, and shall cause a record to be hid up
upon a mount, and a blessing shall be upon it, for I shall recover
my people, and they shall no more be confounded.

Moroni 5:291
 291 For behold, they shall be gathered in from the four quarters of
the earth; from the east, and from the west; from the north,
and from the south; and they shall be gathered in from the east and
from the west.

Moroni 5:292
 292 For behold, I am God, and I shall appear unto them in the form of a man;
for behold, death cometh upon them, and they shall be gathered in from
the four quarters of the earth.

Moroni 5:293
 293 And it shall come to pass that the great Creator of heaven and
earth shall appear unto them in the form of a man, and shall
confess before them all; yea, even unto the earth.

Moroni 5:294
 294 Behold, I am he, and am known of the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost; and this is the power of the Father unto the
preserving of the flesh of the human soul; and this is the
key which is hid from them; and it is the power of the Father and
of the Son that hath preserved them from the fall.

Moroni 5:295
 295 And behold, I am he that sent you out of the land of
Jerusalem, that sent the prophets and plagues, that
whoso would not repenteth not; for he will he will not
deliver.

Moroni they
shall have no place in the land.

Moroni 5:288
 288 And behold, I am he that wrote them; but he that is
frailed, he that is found repaying the debts of the Lord, he
that is found to be eating and drinking in unrighteousness, he
that is found to be reproving his fathers, he is the Son of
God.

Moroni 5:289
 289 Therefore, all these things which I have written, which
are according to the spirit of prophecy, shall come to pass upon
the remnant of the house of Jacob, which shall be scattered upon
all sides.

Moroni 5:290
 290 For thus saith the Lord: After this that I shall prepare a
return for the house of Jacob, and shall cause a record to be hid up
upon a mount, and a blessing shall be upon it, for I shall recover
my people, and they shall no more be confounded.

Moroni 5:291
 291 For behold, they shall be gathered in from the four quarters of
the earth; from the east, and from the west; from the north,
and from the south; and they shall be gathered in from the east and
from the west.

Moroni 5:292
 292 For behold, I am God, and I shall appear unto them in the form of a man;
for behold, death cometh upon them, and they shall be gathered in from
the four quarters of the earth.

Moroni 5:293
 293 And it shall come to pass that the great Creator of heaven and
earth shall appear unto them in the form of a man, and shall
confess before them all; yea, even unto the earth.

Moroni 5:294
 294 Behold, I am he, and am known of the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost; and this is the power of the Father unto the
preserving of the flesh of the human soul; and this is the
key which is hid from them; and it is the power of the Father and
of the Son that hath preserved them from the fall.

Moroni 5:295
 295 And behold, I am he that sent you out of the land of
Jerusalem, that sent the prophets and plagues, that
whoso would not repenteth not; for he will he will not
deliver.

Moroni 5:296
 296 Behold, I am he that said unto Jacob: Fear not this, for
I am the Father, I am he that cometh in the glory of
his Father.

Moroni 5:297
 297 And I am he that opened the womb, and I delivered
my child in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:298
 298 And behold, I am he that spake concerning death, and
remembered the pains of the grave; yea, he said:

Moroni 5:299
 299 I am the first; yea, I am he that cometh in the
glory of my Father.

Moroni 5:300
 300 And I am he that shall be born of the dust of the
earth; I am he that shall be slain with sorrow, and shall
be raised up to meet the children of men.

Moroni 5:301
 301 And it shall come to pass in that day that I shalt comfort the
hearts of the people, and shall be dead unto the world.

Moroni 5:302
 302 And I have become like unto him that cometh in the
paradise of his Father; yea, I have become a father unto the
womb, and I have delivered my son in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:303
 303 Nevertheless, I fear lest the voice of the Lord hath
sounded to me in my memory, that I am he that shall be
born of the dust of the earth, and shall be raised up to meet the
children of men.

Moroni 5:304
 304 Yea, I fear lest he shall say: Am I not a man?
And also, that I am not of the dust, and that I am not of the
earth.

Moroni 5:305
 305 Yea, I fear lest he shall say: I am not of the dust.
But this is of the Father, and of the Son; wherefore, I know
that I am of the Father and am not of the earth.

Moroni 5:306
 306 And I know that thou hast been mindful of my commandments;
wherefore, I know that thou hast kept them.

Moroni 5:307
 307 Yea, and I know that thou hast diligently
performed the labors which thou hast performed.

Moronient the prophets and plagues, that
whoso would not repenteth not; for he will he will not
deliver.

Moroni 5:296
 296 Behold, I am he that said unto Jacob: Fear not this, for
I am the Father, I am he that cometh in the glory of
his Father.

Moroni 5:297
 297 And I am he that opened the womb, and I delivered
my child in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:298
 298 And behold, I am he that spake concerning death, and
remembered the pains of the grave; yea, he said:

Moroni 5:299
 299 I am the first; yea, I am he that cometh in the
glory of my Father.

Moroni 5:300
 300 And I am he that shall be born of the dust of the
earth; I am he that shall be slain with sorrow, and shall
be raised up to meet the children of men.

Moroni 5:301
 301 And it shall come to pass in that day that I shalt comfort the
hearts of the people, and shall be dead unto the world.

Moroni 5:302
 302 And I have become like unto him that cometh in the
paradise of his Father; yea, I have become a father unto the
womb, and I have delivered my son in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:303
 303 Nevertheless, I fear lest the voice of the Lord hath
sounded to me in my memory, that I am he that shall be
born of the dust of the earth, and shall be raised up to meet the
children of men.

Moroni 5:304
 304 Yea, I fear lest he shall say: Am I not a man?
And also, that I am not of the dust, and that I am not of the
earth.

Moroni 5:305
 305 Yea, I fear lest he shall say: I am not of the dust.
But this is of the Father, and of the Son; wherefore, I know
that I am of the Father and am not of the earth.

Moroni 5:306
 306 And I know that thou hast been mindful of my commandments;
wherefore, I know that thou hast kept them.

Moroni 5:307
 307 Yea, and I know that thou hast diligently
performed the labors which thou hast performed.

Moroni 5:308
 308 And I know that thou hast been faithful in keeping the
commandments of thy father.

Moroni 5:309
 309 And I know that thou hast purposed to bring forth
this thy son, even that thou hast conceived of him; and this,
that thy seed might be blameless before the law at the day of
their transgression.

Moroni 5:310
 310 And I know that thou hast loved thy son, as if he
had been thy own; and I know that thou hast suffered even as I
permitted thee to bear.

Moroni 5:311
 311 And I know that thou hast turned away thine
attempts at the law because of the things which thou hast
seen, that thou hast kept the covenants which thou hast
made.

Moroni 5:312
 312 And I know that thou hast suffered much sorrow as I have
suffered; and my soul hath been burdened.

Moroni 5:313
 313 But this is not all; for thou hast also suffered that thy
children should not know concerning thee, that thou hast
brought thyself down from the dead with haste; and in the
darkness did she manifest herself unto the children of men.

Moroni 5:314
 314 And thus hath thy name been blotted out from among the
children of men; therefore, according to the sin which thou hast
committed, thy name shall be blotted out also.

Moroni 5:315
 315 Nevertheless, thou shalt receive in to the kingdom of thy
father; and thou shalt be called thy son, and shalt be called
thy son unto the Lord; and thou shall be with child, and shall be
wounded; and many shall visit thee, and shall comfort thee and
render unto thee according to thy necessities.

Moroni 5:316
 316 And after all this, thou shalt be with child, and shall be
wounded; nevertheless, thou shalt be comforted; many shall
pursue thee, and shall bring thee unto safety; yea, many shall
save thee from destruction.

Moroni 5:317
 317 And then shalt thou say in the parable of the righteous
sons: How blessed are they who return to the Lord their
been faithful in keeping the
commandments of thy father.

Moroni 5:309
 309 And I know that thou hast purposed to bring forth
this thy son, even that thou hast conceived of him; and this,
that thy seed might be blameless before the law at the day of
their transgression.

Moroni 5:310
 310 And I know that thou hast loved thy son, as if he
had been thy own; and I know that thou hast suffered even as I
permitted thee to bear.

Moroni 5:311
 311 And I know that thou hast turned away thine
attempts at the law because of the things which thou hast
seen, that thou hast kept the covenants which thou hast
made.

Moroni 5:312
 312 And I know that thou hast suffered much sorrow as I have
suffered; and my soul hath been burdened.

Moroni 5:313
 313 But this is not all; for thou hast also suffered that thy
children should not know concerning thee, that thou hast
brought thyself down from the dead with haste; and in the
darkness did she manifest herself unto the children of men.

Moroni 5:314
 314 And thus hath thy name been blotted out from among the
children of men; therefore, according to the sin which thou hast
committed, thy name shall be blotted out also.

Moroni 5:315
 315 Nevertheless, thou shalt receive in to the kingdom of thy
father; and thou shalt be called thy son, and shalt be called
thy son unto the Lord; and thou shall be with child, and shall be
wounded; and many shall visit thee, and shall comfort thee and

morning star may be withheld from the mouth of the
black hole, that the light of the sun and of the moon
may not give their light unto men.

Moroni 5:324
 324 And then shall the record which hath been hid from the

of my father, which is the record of my father; whereby I
have written these sayings unto you, that ye may know that I
am he whom the Lord hath put out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:329
 329 Yea, even the spindle was spun by them of old, and
the rod by them of old; and they that did not spin it,
who are they that I have put out of the land of Jerusalem?

Moroni 5:330
 330 Yea, and I have put it forth at the last day; and it

And I do not write the words of my father any more.

Moroni 5:349
 349 And I write these sayings because it so easily passes my
mind as to the things which are expedient in my wisdom
to write.

Moroni 5:350
 350 And I do write the words of my father because of the
greatness of it; for in his wisdom I do not write the words of my
father.

Moroni 5:351
 351 And now I will speak unto my own people, that they may
understand the things which I write.

Moroni 5:352
 352 Behold, I am an unlearned man; yet I know of my father and my
mother; and also my brethren and all the people; and I know that
they must surely understand all my words.

Moroni 5:353

have written they have heard; and they shall judge it, and
confess it, and be baptized in my name.

Moroni 5:350
 350 And I do write the words of my father because of the

 355 For behold, I am sent unto all the house of the
earth; my soul delighteth in the work of my father; and also my
soul delighteth in the of my father.

Moroni 5:356
 356 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had made an end of
speaking unto the people of the Lord he sent again his message unto
the people of the Lamanites, desiring that they would come unto him,
and partake of his righteousness.

Moroni 5:357
 357 And it came to pass that he desired the blood of all the
people who were in the city of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:358
 358 And it came to pass that they all went and did drink the
water of the fountain of the Red Sea, which was in the
seashore.

Moroni 5:359
 359 And he also said unto them: Behold, I am sent to baptize the
water of the fountain of the Red Sea; and after that I have washed my
faces in the uttermost parts of the sea, I shall baptize it in the
confessional of my Father; and this will I do that the sins of the
children of men may be blotted out, that they may be raised
to meet the Father at that great and last day.

Moroni 5:360
 360 Wherefore, my people, Moroni, I desire that ye should come down
among the people of Nephi; and I am he that baptizeth.

Moroni 5:361
 361 Wherefore, I would that ye should know, that I am the
Messenger of the Father, and also the Lord Jesus.

Moroni 5:362
 36 Wherefore, I know that ye know that I am a holy prophet, for
I have written the blasphemy of my father, which was
possible in me, according to my faith; and I have also written
the mystery of my prayer, according to my faith.

Moroni 5:363
 363 For behold, I have testified of your many dealings with
the children of men; and notwithstanding these things
have been spoken concerning you, yet the things which have
been written do not apply to you. For behold, the Lord
their father hath seen them, and hath made them manifest unto
he
earth; my soul delighteth in the work of my father; and also my
soul delighteth in the of my father.

Moroni 5:356
 356 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had made an end of
speaking unto the people of the Lord he sent again his message unto
the people of the Lamanites, desiring that they would come unto him,
and partake of his righteousness.

Moroni 5:357
 357 And it came to pass that he desired the blood of all the
people who were in the city of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:358
 358 And it came to pass that they all went and did drink the
water of the fountain of the Red Sea, which was in the
seashore.

Moroni 5:359
 359 And he also said unto them: Behold, I am sent to baptize the
water of the fountain of the Red Sea; and after that I have washed my
faces in the uttermost parts of the sea, I shall baptize it in the
confessional of my Father; and this will I do that the sins of the
children of men may be blotted out, that they may be raised
to meet the Father at that great and last day.

Moroni 5:360
 360 Wherefore, my people, Moroni, I desire that ye should come down
among the people of Nephi; and I am he that baptizeth.

Moroni 5:361
 361 Wherefore, I would that ye should know, that I am the
Messenger of the Father, and also the Lord Jesus.

Moroni 5:362
 36 Wherefore, I know that ye know that I am a holy prophet, for
I have written the blasphemy of my father, which was
possible in me, according to my faith; and I have also written
the mystery of my prayer, according to my faith.

Moroni 5:363
 363 For behold, I have testified of your many dealings with
the children of men; and notwithstanding these things
have been spoken concerning you, yet the things which have
been written do not apply to you. For behold, the Lord
their father hath seen them, and hath made them manifest unto
them. Wherefore, they shall be made manifest unto all those who
shall believe on their behalf.

Moroni 5:364
 365 Therefore, I write these things unto their father, Moroni, that
they may be written unto the children of men who believe upon
their behalf.

Moroni 5:365
 365 For I know that the Lord will remember my words, for I have
been a just man before him. For I have not taught them that
they shall be kept back, that they may learn to keep the
commandments of the Lord. I say unto you, yea, I say unto you, that
after the Lord hath shown unto me that they shall be kept
back by him, that I did keep them not, that I did not deliver
them out of their awful ignorance; that I did not take them
away, that I did not drive them forth to a place of awful
knowledge; that I did not take their children and bring them
forth unto their father, and also of their brethren, that
they should not know concerning the covenants which they should make
unto themselves.

Moroni 5:366
 366 Therefore, Moroni, I write this epistle unto you, that if ye keep
the commandments of the Lord ye shall be saved.

Moroni 5:367
 367 And now I write unto you that ye may know that if ye will
keep his commandments ye shall be saved; for behold, the Lord
are merciful unto all who are like unto you; and the words which
I have written unto you are they which he hath manifested unto me.

Moroni 5:368
 368 And now I, Moroni, do write these things unto you, that if ye
should keep his commandments, and endure to the end, ye will
be saved.

Moroni 5:369
 369 Wherefore, Moroni, I speak unto you, my beloved brethren, of my
sons, whose records are not yet brought forth unto the children
of men.

Moroni 5:370
 370 Behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the high priest of the church
of God in the church which I lead.

Moroni 5:371
 371 Behold, I am a Nephite; and I am a young man; and it

Moroni 5:364
 365 Therefore, I write these things unto their father, Moroni, that
they may be written unto the children of men who believe upon
their behalf.

Moroni 5:365
 365 For I know that the Lord will remember my words, for I have
been a just man before him. For I have not taught them that
they shall be kept back, that they may learn to keep the
commandments of the Lord. I say unto you, yea, I say unto you, that
after the Lord hath shown unto me that they shall be kept
back by him, that I did keep them not, that I did not deliver

away, that I did not drive them forth to a place of awful
knowledge; that I did not take their children and bring them
forth unto their father, and also of their brethren, that
they should not know concerning the covenants which they should make
unto themselves.

Moroni 5:366
 366 Therefore, Moroni, I write this epistle unto you, that if ye keep
the commandments of the Lord ye shall be saved.

Moroni 5:367
 367 And now I write unto you that ye may know that if ye will
keep his commandments ye shall be saved; for behold, the Lord
are merciful unto all who are like unto you; and the words which
I have written unto you are they which he hath manifested unto me.

Moroni 5:368
 368 And now I, Moroni, do write these things unto you, that if ye
should keep his commandments, and endure to the end, ye will
be saved.

Moroni 5:369

which shall be a song unto themselves, which shall comfort them in
their tribulations.

Moroni 5:395
 395 Yea, even the Lord hath said that: I will write the Psalm of
my glory, and they shall write it among themselves which
shall be a song unto themselves which shall comfort them in their
triumphations. O my people, I have made a song for thee, O house
of Israel, a song of my glory; and thou shalt write it
among thy people.

Moroni 5:396
 396 Thy people thou shalt write and shall write; and many shall
write and shall write; and all this shall thou write and shall
perish not, for thy salvation.

Moroni 5:397
 397 Thy people thou shalt not write nor shall write, for
thy salvation.

Moroni 5:398
 398 For my sake, O house of Israel, have mercy on thy people, that
thy limbs may be unyoked in the flesh, that thou mayest no more
be hindered from doing according to thy flesh.

Moroni 5:399
 399 My soul delighteth in thy welfare; and my heart is grieved for
thy destruction.

Moroni 5:400
 400 For behold, thy redemption cometh through the redemption,
which death hath brought upon the body; therefore, death
hath brought upon the body, and also the resurrection of the body,
and also upon the corruption of the mortal body unto death.

Moroni 5:401
 401 Wherefore, death hath brought upon the body the corruption of
mortality, which corruption bringeth upon the spirit, which spirit
conquereth upon the body again, and bringeth them back to that
death which death brought upon the mortal body.

Moroni 5:402
 402 Wherefore, death bringeth to pass the resurrection of the
body, and also the corruption of the body, which corruption
bringeth about the resurrection of the body, that this death
may have no more power over the spirit, which spirit it is
conquerable from henceforth to rest.

Moroni 5:403
 403 And now, O house of Israel, thou shalt not have any
more part in the spoils of this death, which death shall have
power over the body, or corruption bringeth about, that death
may have no more power over her, which corruption bringeth about
that she may have no more power over the spirit, which spirit is
conquerable from henceforth to rest.

Moroni 5:404
 404 Wherefore, my people, I speak unto you through the
voice of the Lord, according to the spirit of prophecy; for because of
this thereign of the spirit of prophecy hath been
conquered in the spirit of prophecy; therefore he hath given
away his spirit that he might prophesy, according to the words
of the spirit.

Moroni 5:405
 405 Wherefore, the prophets of the spirit have testified
concerning the resurrection of the body; yet they did not know
all things.

Moroni 5:406
 406 Wherefore, the Lord hath said that he would give away the
spirit that he might show unto the children of men the state
of the mortal body at the resurrection of the body; and all
things must surely come according to that which he hath said.

Moroni 5:407
 407 And behold, I speak unto all nations, and kindreds, tongues, and
people, which are not of the same language; wherefore, I speak
concisely unto you, that ye cannot all understand.

Moroni 5:408
 408 But behold, the Lord hath said that: In the resurrection
of the body, and also the corruption thereof, the spirit
shall be restored to the mortal body; and I am he that
showeth it.

Moroni 5:409
 409 For behold, whoso shall repenteth; and is lost.
unto the spirit.

Moroni 5:410the body again, and bringeth them back to that
death which death brought upon the mortal body.

Moroni 5:402
 402 Wherefore, death bringeth to pass the resurrection of the
body, and also the corruption of the body, which corruption
bringeth about the resurrection of the body, that this death
may have no more power over the spirit, which spirit it is
conquerable from henceforth to rest.

Moroni 5:403
 403 And now, O house of Israel, thou shalt not have any
more part in the spoils of this death, which death shall have
power over the body, or corruption bringeth about, that death
may have no more power over her, which corruption bringeth about
that she may have no more power over the spirit, which spirit is
conquerable from henceforth to rest.

Moroni 5:404
 404 Wherefore, my people, I speak unto you through the
voice of the Lord, according to the spirit of prophecy; for because of
this thereign of the spirit of prophecy hath been
conquered in the spirit of prophecy; therefore he hath given
away his spirit that he might prophesy, according to the words
of the spirit.

Moroni 5:405
 405 Wherefore, the prophets of the spirit have testified
concerning the resurrection of the body; yet they did not know
all things.

Moroni 5:406
 406 Wherefore, the Lord hath said that he would give away the
spirit that he might show unto the children of men the state
of the mortal body at the resurrection of the body; and all
things must surely come according to that which he hath said.

Moroni 5:407
 407 And behold, I speak unto all nations, and kindreds, tongues, and
people, which are not of the same language; wherefore, I speak
concisely unto you, that ye cannot all understand.

Moroni 5:408
 408 But behold, the Lord hath said that: In the resurrection
of the body, and also the corruption thereof, the spirit
shall be restored to the mortal body; and I am he that
showeth it.

Moroni 5:409
 409 For behold, whoso shall repenteth; and is lost.
unto the spirit.

Moroni 5:410
 410 But behold, I have written unto you, that the spirit
shall be restored unto the mortal body again; and I know that
this shall be the case with all things which are of the spiritual
world, at the resurrection of the body.

Moroni 5:411
 411 Wherefore, repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the
water of repentance, that ye are not as the sand of the sea,
which, if it should dry, shall be clean again; wherefore, leave
the law unto the spirit and righteousness, depart from law unto
spirit, that ye may be as the sand, which, if it should dry,
shall be new again.

Moroni 5:412
 412 Behold, I speak unto the broken heart of the world;
then cometh the law to be fulfilled; and the promise fulfilled; and
the peace of the Lord come upon you, and upon the house of Israel.

Moroni 5:413
 413 Fear not the things which are of the spirit, for the
things which are of the spirit are of the Lord; for he shall show
unto you theevels of the earth, and shall raise up among you
the mighty among you, to go the far off lands, and establish
tribes, to till the earth.

Moroni 5:414
 414 Behold, I speak unto the wise in heart, and they are dumb.

Moroni 5:415
 415 And it shall come to pass in that day that they shall see
concerning them that they are like unto the fine linen of
their garments.

Moroni 5:416
 416 And they shall say: This is fine linen that we wear; it is
dried in the wind, and it is torn in twain.

Moroni 5:417
 417 And they that are dumb, dumb as to the wisdom of the
world, shall be as a God, and shall be made so by the Spirit
of the Lord, who is the Lord of Hosts.

Moroni 5:418
 418 And they that are wise, the like of whom the Lord
makeeth, shall be like unto them.

Moroni 5:419
 419 Behold, the Lord withstood the mighty man, and
also the man of renown, and by the Spirit of the
Lord, who was among the people.

Moroni 5:420
 420 So greathall repenteth; and is lost.
unto the spirit.

Moroni 5:410
 410 But behold, I have written unto you, that the spirit
shall be restored unto the mortal body again; and I know that
this shall be the case with all things which are of the spiritual
world, at the resurrection of the body.

Moroni 5:411
 411 Wherefore, repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the
water of repentance, that ye are not as the sand of the sea,
which, if it should dry, shall be clean again; wherefore, leave
the law unto the spirit and righteousness, depart from law unto
spirit, that ye may be as the sand, which, if it should dry,
shall be new again.

Moroni 5:412
 412 Behold, I speak unto the broken heart of the world;
then cometh the law to be fulfilled; and the promise fulfilled; and
the peace of the Lord come upon you, and upon the house of Israel.

Moroni 5:413
 413 Fear not the things which are of the spirit, for the
things which are of the spirit are of the Lord; for he shall show
unto you theevels of the earth, and shall raise up among you
the mighty among you, to go the far off lands, and establish
tribes, to till the earth.

Moroni 5:414
 414 Behold, I speak unto the wise in heart, and they are dumb.

Moroni 5:415
 415 And it shall come to pass in that day that they shall see
concerning them that they are like unto the fine linen of
their garments.

Moroni 5:416
 416 And they shall say: This is fine linen that we wear; it is
dried in the wind, and it is torn in twain.

Moroni 5:417
 417 And they that are dumb, dumb as to the wisdom of the
world, shall be as a God, and shall be made so by the Spirit
of the Lord, who is the Lord of Hosts.

Moroni 5:418
 418 And they that are wise, the like of whom the Lord
makeeth, shall be like unto them.

Moroni 5:419
 419 Behold, the Lord withstood the mighty man, and
also the man of renown, and by the Spirit of the
Lord, who was among the people.

Moroni 5:420
 420 So great was the Lord's ministry upon all the face
of the land that the people could not hide nor hide from
his presence.

Moroni 5:421
 421 And the Lord said unto Moses: If the Lord had not made
roads in the wilderness
·

Moroni 5:422
 422 But it should have been done by the way, and it should have
been done by a man among the people.

Moroni 5:423
 423 Yea, and it should have been done by a man among the
people.

Moroni 5:424
 424 And it is written: A prophet shall the Lord your God
not destroy out of the land.

Moroni 5:425
 425 Therefore, make a way for him that hath made the way;
for it is in your best interests that he should be saved.

Moroni 5:426
 426 Therefore, it shall come to pass in that day that he shall
be brought back; and by the power of the Holy Ghost ye shall call
him, his name shall be called; but he is he who made the way.

Moroni 5:427
 427 Therefore, when he shall be found among you making the
way, his name shall be called; and he shall be called, the way,
upon the mountains, and in the valleys.

Moroni 5:428
 428 Therefore, I, Moroni, in the name of the Lord, would speak
concerning your traditions concerning the things of your fathers.

Moroni 5:429
 429 Behold, your fathers were a righteous people; for ye had
rejected all the foolish traditions of the people of the
daughters of Ishmael.

Moroni 5:430
 430 Nevertheless, they taught their children, as well as
their older daughters, that it was their grandmothers that
wrought so much as to stir them up in the Lord
their God.

Moroni 5:431
 432 And thus they were taught to keep the commandments of
the Lord, and to walk in wisdom before him.

Moroni 5:432
 432 But behold, your fathers did teach them strange
things; for they taught them that their grandmother
hath all things, and that she hath all things, of alle
Lord, who was among the people.

Moroni 5:420
 420 So great was the Lord's ministry upon all the face
of the land that the people could not hide nor hide from
his presence.

Moroni 5:421
 421 And the Lord said unto Moses: If the Lord had not made
roads in the wilderness
·

Moroni 5:422
 422 But it should have been done by the way, and it should have
been done by a man among the people.

Moroni 5:423
 423 Yea, and it should have been done by a man among the
people.

Moroni 5:424
 424 And it is written: A prophet shall the Lord your God
not destroy out of the land.

Moroni 5:425
 425 Therefore, make a way for him that hath made the way;
for it is in your best interests that he should be saved.

Moroni 5:426
 426 Therefore, it shall come to pass in that day that he shall
be brought back; and by the power of the Holy Ghost ye shall call
him, his name shall be called; but he is he who made the way.

Moroni 5:427
 427 Therefore, when he shall be found among you making the
way, his name shall be called; and he shall be called, the way,
upon the mountains, and in the valleys.

Moroni 5:428
 428 Therefore, I, Moroni, in the name of the Lord, would speak
concerning your traditions concerning the things of your fathers.

Moroni 5:429
 429 Behold, your fathers were a righteous people; for ye had
rejected all the foolish traditions of the people of the
daughters of Ishmael.

Moroni 5:430
 430 Nevertheless, they taught their children, as well as
their older daughters, that it was their grandmothers that
wrought so much as to stir them up in the Lord
their God.

Moroni 5:431
 432 And thus they were taught to keep the commandments of
the Lord, and to walk in wisdom before him.

Moroni 5:432
 432 But behold, your fathers did teach them strange
things; for they taught them that their grandmother
hath all things, and that she hath all things, of all
things, which are in heaven, and all things which are in the
earth; and they were taught that she hath given unto her
children power to do all things according to that which she
hath said.

Moroni 5:433
 433 And this they said: Our grandmother knoweth all things;
if so, she hath taught us.

Moroni 5:434
 433 But our grandmother hath no power over us; for she hath
made us as well as we.

Moroni 5:435
 435 And it came to pass that they did tremble.

Moroni 5:436
 436 And it came to pass that they did flee before the man
that was carrying them away, even as they did before their
father, who was a transgressor from the beginning.

Moroni 5:437
 37 And the Lord said unto thy father: Go, where thou wilt, and
recoreth the of the Lord; then shalt thou find thy strength.

Moroni 5:438
 38 And thou shalt travel forth until thou findest the
means whereby I can cause thee to be lifted up at the last
day; then shalt thou be found by me.

Moroni 5:439
 39 And thou shalt not remain among the people, until thou
hast found the means whereby thou mayest be found by me.

Moroni 5:440
 40 But I will be merciful unto thee; thou shalt not perish,
that thou mayest have life again, and mayest behold all the
means whereby thou canst be brought forth to meet me.

Moroni 5:441
 41 And I am he that created thee; the beginning was corrupt,
and I have brought thee hither to meet me.

Moroni 5:442
 42 Thou shalt not be ashamed, for thou shalt not be
confounded, for thou shalt not be hid.

Moroni 5:443
 43 For thy mind shall be made childlike, and thy
heart shall be drunken; for ye shall not be ashamed, neither
shall thy face be hid.

Moroni 5:444
 44 For thou shalt not be ashamed, neither shall thy
breast be drunken.

Moroni 5:445
 45 For thou shalt not be humble, neither shalt thou be
counseled.

Moroni 5:446
 46 For thou shalt not bow down thyself unto thell
things, which are in heaven, and all things which are in the
earth; and they were taught that she hath given unto her
children power to do all things according to that which she
hath said.

Moroni 5:433
 433 And this they said: Our grandmother knoweth all things;
if so, she hath taught us.

Moroni 5:434
 433 But our grandmother hath no power over us; for she hath
made us as well as we.

Moroni 5:435
 435 And it came to pass that they did tremble.

Moroni 5:436
 436 And it came to pass that they did flee before the man
that was carrying them away, even as they did before their
father, who was a transgressor from the beginning.

Moroni 5:437
 37 And the Lord said unto thy father: Go, where thou wilt, and
recoreth the of the Lord; then shalt thou find thy strength.

Moroni 5:438
 38 And thou shalt travel forth until thou findest the
means whereby I can cause thee to be lifted up at the last
day; then shalt thou be found by me.

Moroni 5:439
 39 And thou shalt not remain among the people, until thou
hast found the means whereby thou mayest be found by me.

Moroni 5:440
 40 But I will be merciful unto thee; thou shalt not perish,
that thou mayest have life again, and mayest behold all the
means whereby thou canst be brought forth to meet me.

Moroni 5:441
 41 And I am he that created thee; the beginning was corrupt,
and I have brought thee hither to meet me.

Moroni 5:442
 42 Thou shalt not be ashamed, for thou shalt not be
confounded, for thou shalt not be hid.

Moroni 5:443
 43 For thy mind shall be made childlike, and thy
heart shall be drunken; for ye shall not be ashamed, neither
shall thy face be hid.

Moroni 5:444
 44 For thou shalt not be ashamed, neither shall thy
breast be drunken.

Moroni 5:445
 45 For thou shalt not be humble, neither shalt thou be
counseled.

Moroni 5:446
 46 For thou shalt not bow down thyself unto the earth, nor
hide thyself from the body, but thou shalt be loosed from
flesh and shall be made free from all bonds of the body,
that thou mayest be no more lost to the body.

Moroni 5:447
 47 And now, O man, thou shalt awake, and thy young men shall
lay hold upon the young women whom they love; for the Lord hath
commanded them that they should be blameless before him.

Moroni 5:448
 48 For the Lord hath said: I will raise them up at the last
day; then they shall wax old, and they shall no more
need serve me up unto food; then they shall be a cloud, and a
disc, and shall be whirled about like a garment.

Moroni 5:449
 49 But if they are not seen, yet they may be in the
nightingale, for the Lord hath said that they shall be in the
nightingale; and the light of the Lord shall be upon them.

Moroni 5:450
 450 And also the Lord hath said: If they so be, then cometh
unto them great joy; then their joy shall be full also.

Moroni 5:451
 451 And now, O my son, thou hast been nursed by the
hands of men; and this art thou, O man, to be governed by the
governor of thy father; therefore, go; for the time cometh, and
soon cometh, I pray the Lord, that it may be in wisdom that
thou mayest no more be troubled in soul.

Moroni 5:452
 2 For behold, the Lord hath heard thy prayer; and I have
spoken unto thee.

Moroni 5:453
 3 And now it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moroni,
saying: If my people should pray to the Lord their God
with sincere hearts, and with low voices did send forth
their prayers, that they might be heard; then would I
hear their prayers.

Moroni 5:454
 4 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that
he should bring forth the records, the
interpreters, the interpreters into the land of
Middoni; that he should translate the records which
had been handed down by the people of Limow down thyself unto the earth, nor
hide thyself from the body, but thou shalt be loosed from
flesh and shall be made free from all bonds of the body,
that thou mayest be no more lost to the body.

Moroni 5:447
 47 And now, O man, thou shalt awake, and thy young men shall
lay hold upon the young women whom they love; for the Lord hath
commanded them that they should be blameless before him.

Moroni 5:448
 48 For the Lord hath said: I will raise them up at the last
day; then they shall wax old, and they shall no more
need serve me up unto food; then they shall be a cloud, and a
disc, and shall be whirled about like a garment.

Moroni 5:449
 49 But if they are not seen, yet they may be in the
nightingale, for the Lord hath said that they shall be in the
nightingale; and the light of the Lord shall be upon them.

Moroni 5:450
 450 And also the Lord hath said: If they so be, then cometh
unto them great joy; then their joy shall be full also.

Moroni 5:451
 451 And now, O my son, thou hast been nursed by the
hands of men; and this art thou, O man, to be governed by the
governor of thy father; therefore, go; for the time cometh, and
soon cometh, I pray the Lord, that it may be in wisdom that
thou mayest no more be troubled in soul.

Moroni 5:452
 2 For behold, the Lord hath heard thy prayer; and I have
spoken unto thee.

Moroni 5:453
 3 And now it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moroni,
saying: If my people should pray to the Lord their God
with sincere hearts, and with low voices did send forth
their prayers, that they might be heard; then would I
hear their prayers.

Moroni 5:454
 4 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that
he should bring forth the records, the
interpreters, the interpreters into the land of
Middoni; that he should translate the records which
had been handed down by the people of Limhi,
even to the engravings which had been hid up by the
people of Limhi;

Moroni 5:455
 457 And he should translate those records which had
been handed down by the people of Limhi from one language
to another and from one people to another, until the
people of Limhi had translated all the records which
were handed down by them.

Moroni 5:456
 457 And they were handed down by them thus far,
and they were engraven on plates of brass, which had been
made by the people of Limhi.

Moroni 5:457
 457 And Moroni said unto the people:

Moroni 5:458
 458 These records were sacred; and whosoever
brought them forth in the language which we do not understand,
we will defend our liberty and our lives.

Moroni 5:459
 4 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning the
translation of the records. Behold, my son, I speak unto you
concerning the records, which have been brought forth by the
people of Limhi into this land. Behold, they have been
translated into English by the hand of Moroni; and the
translation which was done by the hand of Moroni was
called the book of Mormon.

Moroni 5:460
 460 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that there
should be a record kept of the people of Limhi, both
those who were in the city of Nephi, and those who
were in the city of Gidgiddoni, and those who were in the
city of Naphtali, even until the time came that Moroni
should return again and declare unto the people of Limhi
concerning the records which had been brought forth by
those three persons.

Moroni 5:461
 4 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the
books of Mormon should be kept for the sole purpose of
discerning the records which had been deposited by the
people of Limhi; and for this end Moroni did deliver them up
unto the people in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:462
 46 And now, I, Moroni, do not write the full account of the
transfiguration of the records; but I convey mine
accounts into the record which I have made.

Moroni 5:ple of Limhi;

Moroni 5:455
 457 And he should translate those records which had
been handed down by the people of Limhi from one language
to another and from one people to another, until the
people of Limhi had translated all the records which
were handed down by them.

Moroni 5:456
 457 And they were handed down by them thus far,
and they were engraven on plates of brass, which had been
made by the people of Limhi.

Moroni 5:457
 457 And Moroni said unto the people:

Moroni 5:458
 458 These records were sacred; and whosoever
brought them forth in the language which we do not understand,
we will defend our liberty and our lives.

Moroni 5:459
 4 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning the
translation of the records. Behold, my son, I speak unto you
concerning the records, which have been brought forth by the
people of Limhi into this land. Behold, they have been
translated into English by the hand of Moroni; and the
translation which was done by the hand of Moroni was
called the book of Mormon.

Moroni 5:460
 460 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that there
should be a record kept of the people of Limhi, both
those who were in the city of Nephi, and those who
were in the city of Gidgiddoni, and those who were in the
city of Naphtali, even until the time came that Moroni
should return again and declare unto the people of Limhi
concerning the records which had been brought forth by
those three persons.

Moroni 5:461
 4 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that the
books of Mormon should be kept for the sole purpose of
discerning the records which had been deposited by the
people of Limhi; and for this end Moroni did deliver them up
unto the people in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:462
 46 And now, I, Moroni, do not write the full account of the
transfiguration of the records; but I convey mine
accounts into the record which I have made.

Moroni 5:463
 3 And it came to pass that I gave unto the people of Limhi
concerning the records which had been delivered up unto them;
and it was by the gift and power of God.

Moroni 5:464
 4 And it came to pass that they did love the records more
than the people of Limhi, insomuch that they did desire that
they should be kept and brought forth unto the people of the
Lord; and I, Moroni, did admonish them that they should deliver
them up unto the Lord.

Moroni 5:465
 465 And it came to pass that they did deliver up the
records unto me, saying: We thank you, Moroni, for the privilege
of delivering these records unto us; and we also thank you for
obtaining the languages and the records which ye have obtained by
mining the mines of Limhi.

Moroni 5:466
 4 And it came to pass that when the people of Limhi had
received these records they did return them unto Moroni, and
he read them to them, and said: This is the record which ye
have obtained by the power of the Holy Ghost; and these are the
words of Nephi which he spake, saying:

Moroni 5:467
 47 Remember, my son, this is the language of the king of
my people; and behold, I have translated the records which were
transmitted by the mouth of these three men; and they are the
words of Nephi.

Moroni 5:468
 48 Therefore, my son, I would that ye should know concerning the
words of Nephi; and ye also, my son, I would speak unto you
concerning the translation which ye and I have done.

Moroni 5:469
 49 Behold, I said unto you: My son, that I had never before
touched the records which had been entrusted upon the
hands of the king of my people; and even I had not even before seen the
key of the lock.

Moroni 5:470
 49 And now, my son, that I have said unto you, behold, I know
that the things which I have said shall be true; and I know
that the things which my father hath written shall be
true; wherefore, I know that my Father knoweth the
key of the lock, and he hath shown unto me the place where he
shall keep it.

Morto the people of Limhi
concerning the records which had been delivered up unto them;
and it was by the gift and power of God.

Moroni 5:464
 4 And it came to pass that they did love the records more
than the people of Limhi, insomuch that they did desire that
they should be kept and brought forth unto the people of the
Lord; and I, Moroni, did admonish them that they should deliver
them up unto the Lord.

Moroni 5:465
 465 And it came to pass that they did deliver up the
records unto me, saying: We thank you, Moroni, for the privilege
of delivering these records unto us; and we also thank you for
obtaining the languages and the records which ye have obtained by
mining the mines of Limhi.

Moroni 5:466
 4 And it came to pass that when the people of Limhi had
received these records they did return them unto Moroni, and
he read them to them, and said: This is the record which ye
have obtained by the power of the Holy Ghost; and these are the
words of Nephi which he spake, saying:

Moroni 5:467
 47 Remember, my son, this is the language of the king of
my people; and behold, I have translated the records which were
transmitted by the mouth of these three men; and they are the
words of Nephi.

Moroni 5:468
 48 Therefore, my son, I would that ye should know concerning the
words of Nephi; and ye also, my son, I would speak unto you
concerning the translation which ye and I have done.

Moroni 5:469
 49 Behold, I said unto you: My son, that I had never before
touched the records which had been entrusted upon the
hands of the king of my people; and even I had not even before seen the
key of the lock.

Moroni 5:470
 49 And now, my son, that I have said unto you, behold, I know
that the things which I have said shall be true; and I know
that the things which my father hath written shall be
true; wherefore, I know that my Father knoweth the
key of the lock, and he hath shown unto me the place where he
shall keep it.

Moroni 5:471
 5 Wherefore, my son, I would speak unto you concerning the
keys of the locks; for behold, I know they are not sufficiently
kept.

Moroni 5:472
 4 I say unto you that I know that they are not sufficiently
kept in the hands of those who have been entrusted with the
deeds of the people; for behold, they are in the land of Ishmael,
and they are hunting.

Moroni 5:473
 3 And now I speak concerning the records which have
been handed down by the being of Nephi, which are the
record of his people from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even
until the coming of Christ.

Moroni 5:474
 4 Behold, my son, they are called the records which have
been handed down by the people of Nephi; wherefore, after the
record of the kings, it is given unto the people of Nephi; wherefore,
the people of Nephi, who are the people of the Lord, may know,
that they are true; and their faith is strong, insomuch that
they do remember that which they have read.

Moroni 5:475
 5 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, remember the
murders of his people, which he committed in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:476
 6 Now, my son, I do not write upon these plates all the words
which my father hath written; for he hath written many things upon
plates which he had found upon the bottom of the sea; wherefore,
they cannot be written upon these plates, which he hath
written.

Moroni 5:477
 7 But, my son, I will write the words which he hath written; and
when the time cometh that we shall find all things
written according to our faith, then will I write the words of my
father.

Moroni 5:478
 8 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat unto you concerning the
records which have been handed down by the people of
Limhi; for behold, this is the thing which concerns the
blood of my father; and it concerns the records which have
been handed down from one generation to another, which
tell of the coming of Christ, even to the destruction
of my people.

Mor:471
 5 Wherefore, my son, I would speak unto you concerning the
keys of the locks; for behold, I know they are not sufficiently
kept.

Moroni 5:472
 4 I say unto you that I know that they are not sufficiently
kept in the hands of those who have been entrusted with the
deeds of the people; for behold, they are in the land of Ishmael,
and they are hunting.

Moroni 5:473
 3 And now I speak concerning the records which have
been handed down by the being of Nephi, which are the
record of his people from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even
until the coming of Christ.

Moroni 5:474
 4 Behold, my son, they are called the records which have
been handed down by the people of Nephi; wherefore, after the
record of the kings, it is given unto the people of Nephi; wherefore,
the people of Nephi, who are the people of the Lord, may know,
that they are true; and their faith is strong, insomuch that
they do remember that which they have read.

Moroni 5:475
 5 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, remember the
murders of his people, which he committed in the wilderness.

Moroni 5:476
 6 Now, my son, I do not write upon these plates all the words
which my father hath written; for he hath written many things upon
plates which he had found upon the bottom of the sea; wherefore,
they cannot be written upon these plates, which he hath
written.

Moroni 5:477
 7 But, my son, I will write the words which he hath written; and
when the time cometh that we shall find all things
written according to our faith, then will I write the words of my
father.

Moroni 5:478
 8 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat unto you concerning the
records which have been handed down by the people of
Limhi; for behold, this is the thing which concerns the
blood of my father; and it concerns the records which have
been handed down from one generation to another, which
tell of the coming of Christ, even to the destruction
of my people.

Moroni 5:479
 4 And now, my son, I would speak concerning the records
which have been handed down from one generation to another.
For behold, my son, this generation has seen its
way into the past; and it is the generation which hath
persecuted the records and the holy scriptures which are
given unto the people.

Moroni 5:480
 4 Wherefore, I speak unto the people of this generation, and
the people of my father, concerning the records which have
been handed down from one generation to another, which
concerning the prophecies of the coming of Christ.

Moroni 5:481
 5 For behold, my son, these things are written unto the
people of Nephi; and they are written in the book which is
presented unto the people, which is the record of the
people of the Lord from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem until
the day that he returned unto the land.

Moroni 5:482
 5 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them in
his judgment; yea, even in his strongest state, when he
dwelt upon the throne of his inheritance in the heavens.

Moroni 5:483
 5 And he did visit them in his fierce anger, that they
began to be frightened; yea, even they were brought out of the
earth; yea, even they were brought far away from this time
until the day that they should be brought before the judgment-seat of
Christ.

Moroni 5:484
 5 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning this thing; for I
know that my father hath written many things which he hath read in
his spirit; and I also know that he had many things which he
had read in the spirit, which were written in the book
which he had brought from the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:485
 5 But, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these things; for
I know that my father hath repented of his sins; and I know that
he repented of his transgressions; for he said:

Moroni 5:486
 4 I know that thou hast seen visions; and also, I know that thou
hast seen a vision; and thou hast heard a voice; and thou hast
heard a manifestation of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, my son,
by the gift of God, thou knowoncerning the records
which have been handed down from one generation to another.
For behold, my son, this generation has seen its
way into the past; and it is the generation which hath
persecuted the records and the holy scriptures which are
given unto the people.

Moroni 5:480
 4 Wherefore, I speak unto the people of this generation, and
the people of my father, concerning the records which have
been handed down from one generation to another, which
concerning the prophecies of the coming of Christ.

Moroni 5:481
 5 For behold, my son, these things are written unto the
people of Nephi; and they are written in the book which is
presented unto the people, which is the record of the
people of the Lord from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem until
the day that he returned unto the land.

Moroni 5:482
 5 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them in
his judgment; yea, even in his strongest state, when he
dwelt upon the throne of his inheritance in the heavens.

Moroni 5:483
 5 And he did visit them in his fierce anger, that they
began to be frightened; yea, even they were brought out of the
earth; yea, even they were brought far away from this time
until the day that they should be brought before the judgment-seat of
Christ.

Moroni 5:484
 5 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning this thing; for I
know that my father hath written many things which he hath read in
his spirit; and I also know that he had many things which he
had read in the spirit, which were written in the book
which he had brought from the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 5:485
 5 But, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these things; for
I know that my father hath repented of his sins; and I know that
he repented of his transgressions; for he said:

Moroni 5:486
 4 I know that thou hast seen visions; and also, I know that thou
hast seen a vision; and thou hast heard a voice; and thou hast
heard a manifestation of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, my son,
by the gift of God, thou knowest that these things are true.

Moroni 5:487
 5 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning the
presentment of the Holy Ghost. Behold, I have kept the records
of my father, which was prepared from the foundation of
the world; and I have also kept the records of my mother,
which were handed down by my father from generation to
generation.

Moroni 5:488
 5 And I know that these things are true; and I know that they
are of God, for they have been kept and preserved by him
from generation to generation; and I pray him that he will teach them
unto this people.

Moroni 5:489
 5 Behold, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these records;
for there had been given them unto the children of men a
flesh and blood separation; wherefore, and according as the Lord
had commanded him, they were kept and preserved by him.

Moroni 5:490
 5 And he also had many records given unto him of the
transgressions of the people; for behold, he translated many
things which were difficult for men to translate.

Moroni 5:491
 5 And his record could not be made known, as to all the
transgressions of his people; therefore, he translated them
concerning things which were pertaining unto righteousness.

Moroni 5:492
 5 For behold, I said unto you that there were many things which he
transfigured;

Moroni 5:493
 5 And he also touched upon the conduct of the people of the
priesthood, which was in the land of Jerusalem, and concerning
the raising of sheep.

Moroni 5:494
 5 And he also read unto the people of the people from the
dead, and also many things which had been forbidden by the
commandments of the Lord, which he had obtained by the power of
his finger.

Moroni 5:495
 5 And it came to pass that he ended his record, save he should
be commanded to continue.

Moroni 5:496
 5 And I did not desire the record to be written upon plates;
therefore, I did write the record upon the plates; and I have
written the record upon plates of which my father has
speculated.

Moroni 5:497
 5 But behold, he hath not suffered that I should writee true.

Moroni 5:487
 5 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning the
presentment of the Holy Ghost. Behold, I have kept the records
of my father, which was prepared from the foundation of
the world; and I have also kept the records of my mother,
which were handed down by my father from generation to
generation.

Moroni 5:488
 5 And I know that these things are true; and I know that they
are of God, for they have been kept and preserved by him
from generation to generation; and I pray him that he will teach them
unto this people.

Moroni 5:489
 5 Behold, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these records;
for there had been given them unto the children of men a
flesh and blood separation; wherefore, and according as the Lord
had commanded him, they were kept and preserved by him.

Moroni 5:490
 5 And he also had many records given unto him of the
transgressions of the people; for behold, he translated many
things which were difficult for men to translate.

Moroni 5:491
 5 And his record could not be made known, as to all the
transgressions of his people; therefore, he translated them
concerning things which were pertaining unto righteousness.

Moroni 5:492
 5 For behold, I said unto you that there were many things which he
transfigured;

Moroni 5:493
 5 And he also touched upon the conduct of the people of the
priesthood, which was in the land of Jerusalem, and concerning
the raising of sheep.

Moroni 5:494
 5 And he also read unto the people of the people from the
dead, and also many things which had been forbidden by the
commandments of the Lord, which he had obtained by the power of
his finger.

Moroni 5:495
 5 And it came to pass that he ended his record, save he should
be commanded to continue.

Moroni 5:496
 5 And I did not desire the record to be written upon plates;
therefore, I did write the record upon the plates; and I have
written the record upon plates of which my father has
speculated.

Moroni 5:497
 5 But behold, he hath not suffered that I should write the
record upon plates, which was prepared by the commandment of
God.

Moroni 5:498
 5 For God said unto Moses: Leviticus 9:2
 2 Speak thou, O Israel, my son, the words which I commanded
thou; for the Lord hath put forth his hand in the wilderness,
which he took from the children of the land, O house of Jacob.

Moroni 5:499
 5 And also, the Lord hath said: My people, hear ye this; my
servant, Leviticus 9:3. 3 For the Lord my God hath placed me
upon the mountains of the heights, and on the hills of the
borders; wherefore, I, I, I, shall return again.

Moroni 5:500
 5 O my people, hear ye these words; for out of my mouth
shall come forth mine arm, and out of my mouth shall my
servant deliver thee.

Moroni 5:501
 5 For the Lord hath put me out of the way; out of the way shall
my servant deliver thee.

Moroni 5:502
 5 For the Lord said unto Moses: I will raise up a Moses
among you; and he shall bring forth in his might the words of
my people, which shall be written upon the plates of which my
father hath spoken.

Moroni 5:503
 5 And the Lord said also: I will give unto him a name; and I will
give him a place at my right hand, that he may write the
record upon the plates of which my father has spoken.

Moroni 5:504
 5 Therefore, Leviticus 9:4. 4 And the Lord said also:
Behold, I will give unto him a name, that he may be called the
Lord; and also, the Lord the book; for he shall write the
records which shall be kept and preserved by the children of
men.

Moroni 5:505
 5 Wherefore, Leviticus 9:5. 5 Wherefore, the Lord said also:
Behold, I will give unto him the book of which my father hath
written the records.

Moroni 5:506
 5 And it came to pass that the Lord said also unto him:
Behold, I will write the record of my father, which shall bethe record upon plates of which my father has
speculated.

Moroni 5:497
 5 But behold, he hath not suffered that I should write the
record upon plates, which was prepared by the commandment of
God.

Moroni 5:498
 5 For God said unto Moses: Leviticus 9:2
 2 Speak thou, O Israel, my son, the words which I commanded
thou; for the Lord hath put forth his hand in the wilderness,
which he took from the children of the land, O house of Jacob.

Moroni 5:499
 5 And also, the Lord hath said: My people, hear ye this; my
servant, Leviticus 9:3. 3 For the Lord my God hath placed me
upon the mountains of the heights, and on the hills of the
borders; wherefore, I, I, I, shall return again.

Moroni 5:500
 5 O my people, hear ye these words; for out of my mouth
shall come forth mine arm, and out of my mouth shall my
servant deliver thee.

Moroni 5:501
 5 For the Lord hath put me out of the way; out of the way shall
my servant deliver thee.

Moroni 5:502
 5 For the Lord said unto Moses: I will raise up a Moses
among you; and he shall bring forth in his might the words of
my people, which shall be written upon the plates of which my
father hath spoken.

Moroni 5:503
 5 And the Lord said also: I will give unto him a name; and I will
give him a place at my right hand, that he may write the
record upon the plates of which my father has spoken.

Moroni 5:504
 5 Therefore, Leviticus 9:4. 4 And the Lord said also:
Behold, I will give unto him a name, that he may be called the
Lord; and also, the Lord the book; for he shall write the
records which shall be kept and preserved by the children of
men.

Moroni 5:505
 5 Wherefore, Leviticus 9:5. 5 Wherefore, the Lord said also:
Behold, I will give unto him the book of which my father hath
written the records.

Moroni 5:506
 5 And it came to pass that the Lord said also unto him:
Behold, I will write the record of my father, which shall be
woven through the writings of my people;

Moroni 5:507
 5 For the Lord hath said: Write them not, for I will make
them not.]

Moroni 5:508
 5 But behold, I will write them upon the plates of which my
father hath written the records; and the Lord hath said also:
Write them not, for I will make them not.

Moroni 5:509
 5 And the Lord said also: I will make the plates of which my
father hath written the records, which shall be kept and preserved
by the children of my people, like unto the records which shall be
woven through the writings of my people.

Moroni 5:510
 5 Therefore, Leviticus 9:6. 6 Wherefore, Joseph, whom my
father hath called
my son, whom I have also called my son, behold, I have made him
an instrument in the hands of the Lord that he may be a king over
my people.

Moroni 5:511
 5 Wherefore, Joseph, whom I have called my son, being an
instrument in the hands of the Lord that he may be a king over the
people of Nephi, behold, I make him an instrument in the hands of the Lord
to be a king over the people of Nephi.

Moroni 5:512
 5 Now Joseph, being an instrument in the hands of the Lord,
cannot be a king over the people of the Nephites; wherefore,
he is a king over the people of the Nephites; and all that
are among them shall be confederates of the people of Joseph.

Moroni 5:513
 5 And I make him a ruler over the people of the Nephites; and
he shall rule over the land forever.

Moroni 5:514
 5 And now, I make a ruler of the people of the Nephites,
that he may be a king over the people of the whole earth, as
to whomsoever the Lord God shall call.

Moroni 5:515
 5 And I make him a ruler over the earth; that he may be
a king over all the nations which the Lord God shall
conquer; for the land in which healso unto him:
Behold, I will write the record of my father, which shall be
woven through the writings of my people;

Moroni 5:507
 5 For the Lord hath said: Write them not, for I will make
them not.]

Moroni 5:508
 5 But behold, I will write them upon the plates of which my
father hath written the records; and the Lord hath said also:
Write them not, for I will make them not.

Moroni 5:509
 5 And the Lord said also: I will make the plates of which my
father hath written the records, which shall be kept and preserved
by the children of my people, like unto the records which shall be
woven through the writings of my people.

Moroni 5:510
 5 Therefore, Leviticus 9:6. 6 Wherefore, Joseph, whom my
father hath called
my son, whom I have also called my son, behold, I have made him
an instrument in the hands of the Lord that he may be a king over
my people.

Moroni 5:511
 5 Wherefore, Joseph, whom I have called my son, being an
instrument in the hands of the Lord that he may be a king over the
people of Nephi, behold, I make him an instrument in the hands of the Lord
to be a king over the people of Nephi.

Moroni 5:512
 5 Now Joseph, being an instrument in the hands of the Lord,
cannot be a king over the people of the Nephites; wherefore,
he is a king over the people of the Nephites; and all that
are among them shall be confederates of the people of Joseph.

Moroni 5:513
 5 And I make him a ruler over the people of the Nephites; and
he shall rule over the land forever.

Moroni 5:514
 5 And now, I make a ruler of the people of the Nephites,
that he may be a king over the people of the whole earth, as
to whomsoever the Lord God shall call.

Moroni 5:515
 5 And I make him a ruler over the earth; that he may be
a king over all the nations which the Lord God shall
conquer; for the land in which he shall be a king shall be his
land forever.

Moroni 5:516
 5 Now this was the language of Joseph, and he spake plainly
unto the Nephites, saying:

Moroni 5:517
 5 Behold, I am a man; a man of the Lord; a man of the
Messiah; and all those who are of the house of Israel shall be
blessed in the land which the Lord God shall show unto me.

Moroni 5:518
 5 Wherefore, my brethren, and all those who are of the house
of Israel, be ye therefore blessed in the land which the Lord
God shall show unto you; for behold, the Lord God shall not suffer
that ye shall perish in the land; for the Lord God will make of
his people a land of their inheritance, that they shall no more be
discovered by the Gentiles.

Moroni 5:519
 5 But the Lord God shall show unto you a land which is a land
of promise; wherefore, shall ye seek that which the Lord God shall
command you?

Moroni 5:520
 5 And if ye find it, and will hearken unto the words of the
prophets, saying, I am the Lord thy God, the Lord thy
God, and this day thou shalt have the better part of the land
that thou shalt possess.

Moroni 5:521
 5 And give ear unto the words of the prophets which were
spoken by Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the holy one of Israel.

Moroni 5:522
 5 For behold, my beloved brethren, it shall come to pass that
then cometh a great king over the people, who shall be a descendant
of the Lord; and he shall be exalted; and he shall be a king over
the earth, and shall be a ruler over the kings of the nations.

Moroni 5:523
 5 For this cause shall the words of Isaiah be fulfilled.

Moroni 5:524
 5 For thus saith Isaiah: My beloved brethren, the Lord
God shall make ready his sword, and shall smite the
earth beneath his feet.

Moroni 5:525
 5 And then cometh the day that he shall slay the
Harmoniites, and shall be merciful unto the people. For
he shall hide up his people in darkness, and shall
strengland forever.

Moroni 5:516
 5 Now this was the language of Joseph, and he spake plainly
unto the Nephites, saying:

Moroni 5:517
 5 Behold, I am a man; a man of the Lord; a man of the
Messiah; and all those who are of the house of Israel shall be
blessed in the land which the Lord God shall show unto me.

Moroni 5:518
 5 Wherefore, my brethren, and all those who are of the house
of Israel, be ye therefore blessed in the land which the Lord
God shall show unto you; for behold, the Lord God shall not suffer
that ye shall perish in the land; for the Lord God will make of
his people a land of their inheritance, that they shall no more be
discovered by the Gentiles.

Moroni 5:519
 5 But the Lord God shall show unto you a land which is a land
of promise; wherefore, shall ye seek that which the Lord God shall
command you?

Moroni 5:520
 5 And if ye find it, and will hearken unto the words of the
prophets, saying, I am the Lord thy God, the Lord thy
God, and this day thou shalt have the better part of the land
that thou shalt possess.

Moroni 5:521
 5 And give ear unto the words of the prophets which were
spoken by Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the holy one of Israel.

Moroni 5:522
 5 For behold, my beloved brethren, it shall come to pass that
then cometh a great king over the people, who shall be a descendant
of the Lord; and he shall be exalted; and he shall be a king over
the earth, and shall be a ruler over the kings of the nations.

Moroni 5:523
 5 For this cause shall the words of Isaiah be fulfilled.

Moroni 5:524
 5 For thus saith Isaiah: My beloved brethren, the Lord
God shall make ready his sword, and shall smite the
earth beneath his feet.

Moroni 5:525
 5 And then cometh the day that he shall slay the
Harmoniites, and shall be merciful unto the people. For
he shall hide up his people in darkness, and shall
strengthen up the people in their afflictions.

Moroni 5:526
 5 The Lord shall make a way for the prey, and shall
deliver them to an abundant harvest.

Moroni 5:527
 5 My beloved brethren, this is the way; and then cometh
the great famine; and then cometh the great and
famine, the pestilence, and the destruction of the
people.

Moroni 5:528
 5 And then cometh the sword of justice, that it may be no
more stretched forth, neither shortened, neither shall the
people starve again.

Moroni 5:529
 5 My beloved brethren, these are the words of Isaiah:

Moroni 5:530
 5 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto thee; and I have told thee
all the thoughts of my heart.

Moroni 5:531
 5 Therefore turn away thine eyes from this time, and
receive up thy lamentations from thenceforth; for the
day that I shall rest my hand upon thy soul, I will send
forth a new star.

Moroni 5:532
 5 Awake, awake, awake; awake from the dust, O Jerusalem; awake
from the dust, O daughter of Zion; arise, stand up, O daughter of
Zion; arise, and arise, for in thy whole body shall I see
rest my throne.

Moroni 5:533
 5 Stand up, O daughter of Zion; rise up, O daughter of my
rejoicings; for in thy whole body shall I see shall my plans
fruitful.

Moroni 5:534
 5 My daughter, Zion; awake, awake; for in thy whole being
I will see my children; they shall be gathered together to the
seat of their inheritance; and kings shall be thy God.

Moroni 5:535
 5 Shake thyself from the dust, O daughter of Zion; and
remain still, O daughter of Jerusalem; for out of the dust
shall they all be gathered together.

Moroni 5:536
 5 And then shall they gather themselves together, and become
as the dust, and become as a river, which, when she
is dry, is gone forth upon the face of all the earth.

Moroni 5:537
 5 Then shall they mourn for the lossess, and shall
strengthen up the people in their afflictions.

Moroni 5:526
 5 The Lord shall make a way for the prey, and shall
deliver them to an abundant harvest.

Moroni 5:527
 5 My beloved brethren, this is the way; and then cometh
the great famine; and then cometh the great and
famine, the pestilence, and the destruction of the
people.

Moroni 5:528
 5 And then cometh the sword of justice, that it may be no
more stretched forth, neither shortened, neither shall the
people starve again.

Moroni 5:529
 5 My beloved brethren, these are the words of Isaiah:

Moroni 5:530
 5 Behold, I have spoken plainly unto thee; and I have told thee
all the thoughts of my heart.

Moroni 5:531
 5 Therefore turn away thine eyes from this time, and
receive up thy lamentations from thenceforth; for the
day that I shall rest my hand upon thy soul, I will send
forth a new star.

Moroni 5:532
 5 Awake, awake, awake; awake from the dust, O Jerusalem; awake
from the dust, O daughter of Zion; arise, stand up, O daughter of
Zion; arise, and arise, for in thy whole body shall I see
rest my throne.

Moroni 5:533
 5 Stand up, O daughter of Zion; rise up, O daughter of my
rejoicings; for in thy whole body shall I see shall my plans
fruitful.

Moroni 5:534
 5 My daughter, Zion; awake, awake; for in thy whole being
I will see my children; they shall be gathered together to the
seat of their inheritance; and kings shall be thy God.

Moroni 5:535
 5 Shake thyself from the dust, O daughter of Zion; and
remain still, O daughter of Jerusalem; for out of the dust
shall they all be gathered together.

Moroni 5:536
 5 And then shall they gather themselves together, and become
as the dust, and become as a river, which, when she
is dry, is gone forth upon the face of all the earth.

Moroni 5:537
 5 Then shall they mourn for the loss of the slain, and
for the loss of the slain of the people; they shall
be avenged upon the people of their own accord.

Moroni 5:538
 5 They shall bury the dead up to the earth, and they shall
rejoice, for they shall be trodden under their
feet by the people of their own accord.

Moroni 5:539
 5 They shall lie down in their own paths, and shall
be drunken with the blood of their own children.

Moroni 5:540
 5 Then shall the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, declare his
judgments, and gather together his experts, and they
shall judge the people of the land.

Moroni 5:541
 5 They shall write the judgments, and write them in the
earth; and they shall come to pass after they have written
the judgments.

Moroni 5:542
 5 Then shall the people mourn for the loss of the slain,
and for the loss of the slain of the people; and they
shall be drunken with the blood of their own children.

Moroni 5:543
 5 Then shall the Lord of Hosts say: I have rested the
flesh of thee, O daughter of Zion; the fear of the Lord shall
come upon thee, and all the fury of his anger shall be
kindreds upon the face of the nations.

Moroni 5:544
 5 Fear not the Lord, till thou hast learned the language of
the children of men.

Moroni 5:545
 5 Be not ye therefore like unto them, for behold, I have taught
thy sons that they should fear me, and they have learned to fear
me.

Moroni 5:546
 5 Teach them, that they may learn also from my words, and
learn wisdom; for, behold, I am God, and there is none other
man in the heavens above.

Moroni 5:547
 5 Therefore, I am he that teacheth unto the children
of men, that they should know the mysteries of the
Gentiles; for he that teacheth them, the same hath
knowledge of the mysteries of God.

Moroni 5:548
 5 Therefore, all things which are of the children of men
shall be written in the book, save a few things which
are written, and
for the loss of the slain of the people; they shall
be avenged upon the people of their own accord.

Moroni 5:538
 5 They shall bury the dead up to the earth, and they shall
rejoice, for they shall be trodden under their
feet by the people of their own accord.

Moroni 5:539
 5 They shall lie down in their own paths, and shall
be drunken with the blood of their own children.

Moroni 5:540
 5 Then shall the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, declare his
judgments, and gather together his experts, and they
shall judge the people of the land.

Moroni 5:541
 5 They shall write the judgments, and write them in the
earth; and they shall come to pass after they have written
the judgments.

Moroni 5:542
 5 Then shall the people mourn for the loss of the slain,
and for the loss of the slain of the people; and they
shall be drunken with the blood of their own children.

Moroni 5:543
 5 Then shall the Lord of Hosts say: I have rested the
flesh of thee, O daughter of Zion; the fear of the Lord shall
come upon thee, and all the fury of his anger shall be
kindreds upon the face of the nations.

Moroni 5:544
 5 Fear not the Lord, till thou hast learned the language of

 5 Therefore, I am he that teacheth unto the children
of men, that they should know the mysteries of the
Gentiles; for he that teacheth them, the same hath
knowledge of the mysteries of God.

Moroni 5:548
 5 Therefore, all things which are of the children of men
shall be written in the book, save a few things which
are written by the Gentiles; for I say unto you, that the
Book which is written by the Gentiles shall be a crown for
the children of men.

Moroni 5:549
 5 But behold, this is not all--there shall be a book
written by the Gentiles, which shall be called the finished
book.

Moroni 5:550
 5 And this book shall be hid up among the dead, and shall
be read by the children of men.

Moroni 5:551
 5 And then shall the book be unfolded, and shall be read
whatsoever things are written by them which are written by
the Gentiles.

Moroni 5:552
 5 Then shall the reader be brought near unto the book,
that he may read all things which are written by them
which are not written by the Gentiles.

Moroni 5:553
 5 Then shall the book be opened, and there shall the writings
which are not written by the Gentiles be unfolded, and the
words which are not written by the Gentiles shall be
interpreted.

Moroni 5:554
 5 For those scriptures which have been given by the
Gentiles, which are not of the plates of brass, shall be read
thereby; and there shall be a distinction made between the
Gentiles and the children of men, that a remnant of the
Gentiles may be restored unto them, that the remainder may be
converted unto the Lord, that they may be brought to that
rest, which is prepared for them according to their works.

Moroni 5:555
 5 For behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that the
word of the Lord shall not be fulfilled which I have written.

Moroni 5:556
 5 Behold, I have written the things which I have written, and
declare them unto you; and then I finish not what I have written.

Moroni 5:557
 5 And I would that ye should know that I have not written
all things which are written, neither have I written all the
things which were written by the prophets; for I have
declared them unto you, and made known the things which were
prepared by the prophets to the children of men, of whom
the prophets were written.

Moroni 5:558
 5 And then, at this time, I do not write all the things which
he Gentiles shall be a crown for
the children of men.

Moroni 5:549
 5 But behold, this is not all--there shall be a book
written by the Gentiles, which shall be called the finished
book.

Moroni 5:550
 5 And this book shall be hid up among the dead, and shall
be read by the children of men.

Moroni 5:551
 5 And then shall the book be unfolded, and shall be read
whatsoever things are written by them which are written by

Moroni 5:552
 5 Then shall the reader be brought near unto the book,
that he may read all things which are written by them
which are not written by the Gentiles.

Moroni 5:553
 5 Then shall the book be opened, and there shall the writings
which are not written by the Gentiles be unfolded, and the

interpreted.

Moroni 5:555
 5 For behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that the
word of the Lord shall not be fulfilled which I have written.

Moroni 5:556
 5 Behold, I have written the things which I have written, and
declare them unto you; and then I finish not what I have written.

Moroni 5:557
 5 And I would that ye should know that I have not written
all things which are written, neither have I written all the
things which were written by the prophets; for I have
declared them unto you, and made known the things which were
prepared by the prophets to the children of men, of whom
the prophets were written.

Moroni 5:558
 5 And then, at this time, I do not write all the things which
have been written by the prophets. But I do prepare mine
own mouth, that none of the things which have been written
by the prophets shall be translated into the languages which
are not of this people.

Moroni 5:559
 5 Therefore, I write the things which have been written by
the prophets, that none may know them save they shall be made known
to the children of men.

Moroni 5:560
 5 For it is given unto them that they may prophesy concerning
things which are to come; nevertheless, all things
which are written by the prophets, which have been made known
unto this people, are of the Lord.

Moroni 5:561
 5 And the Lord knoweth all things which shall befall this people.
And the Lord knoweth all that shall come unto this people, that
the remnant of the house of Jacob is scattered, and
their land is taken from them, and their brethren
shall be scattered among all nations.

Moroni 5:562
 5 Therefore, the Lord God will cry unto this people, saying:

Moroni 5:563
 5 My sheep, where is the flock of which I have spoken?
Where is the flock of which I have spoken?

Moroni 5:564
 5 Ye know that it hath been scattered abroad; neither
have they found any land which was suitable for them;
therefore, the Lord hath commanded me that I should send
them forth.

Moroni 5:565
 5 And I have done, and they are with you, and they are well
padded.

Moroni 5:566
 5 And you may well be assured that they are well padded; for
their food is good, and their drink is bitter.

Moroni 5:567
 5 They are daily occupied with work, that they may labor
with their might toil, that they may be lifted up at
the last day.

Moroni 5:568
 5 And now, behold, I say unto you, that the words which I have
spoken unto you are not of myself, but they are of the Lord;
and I know that he hath spoken them by his Holy Spirit,
which is the Holy One of Israel; and I know that God hath
commanded that I should speak them by his Holy Spirit.

Moroni 5:569
 5 And I said unto them: Lord, have mercy on my sons. But I do prepare mine
own mouth, that none of the things which have been written
by the prophets shall be translated into the languages which
are not of this people.

Moroni 5:559
 5 Therefore, I write the things which have been written by
the prophets, that none may know them save they shall be made known
to the children of men.

Moroni 5:560
 5 For it is given unto them that they may prophesy concerning
things which are to come; nevertheless, all things
which are written by the prophets, which have been made known
unto this people, are of the Lord.

Moroni 5:561
 5 And the Lord knoweth all things which shall befall this people.
And the Lord knoweth all that shall come unto this people, that
the remnant of the house of Jacob is scattered, and
their land is taken from them, and their brethren
shall be scattered among all nations.

Moroni 5:562
 5 Therefore, the Lord God will cry unto this people, saying:

Moroni 5:563
 5 My sheep, where is the flock of which I have spoken?
Where is the flock of which I have spoken?

Moroni 5:564
 5 Ye know that it hath been scattered abroad; neither
have they found any land which was suitable for them;
therefore, the Lord hath commanded me that I should send

Moroni 5:567
 5 They are daily occupied with work, that they may labor

the last day.

Moroni 5:568
 5 And now, behold, I say unto you, that the words which I have
spoken unto you are not of myself, but they are of the Lord;
and I know that he hath spoken them by his Holy Spirit,
which is the Holy One of Israel; and I know that God hath
commanded that I should speak them by his Holy Spirit.

Moroni 5:569
 5 And I said unto them: Lord, have mercy on my sons; and
have mercy they have--and I know that they are your souls
that are in heaven; and ye are brought down down into the
garden by the Holy One of Israel, and your substance that
is in heaven is appertain to that which is appertain to the body.

Moroni 5:570
 5 And now, because of the things which ye have done, the Lord
hath commanded me that I should say unto this people:

Moroni 5:571
 5 My sheep, where art thou?

Moroni 5:572
 5 I know that thou art thou because thou hast put on thy
hearts, and acted according to the spirit which is in thee.

Moroni 5:573
 5 And the Lord hath commanded me that I should speak unto thee by
the spirit of prophecy, and by the spirit of revelation.

Moroni 5:574
 5 And it came to pass that I said unto her: Lord, have mercy on my
sons, that they are not all with us at this time; for I
know that they are; for the Lord hath said unto them:<|endoftext|>Cleveland Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson (10) is fouled by Philadelphia 76ers forward C.J. Miles (22) during the first half of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals at Quicken Loans Arena.

The 76ers are coming off a 37-point win over the 76ers in the first round of the playoffs at the Center City Sports Arena.

stiff on their own ends.


The game was tied at 60 with 3:15 remaining. But the Bulls, for some reason, didn't
play their best basketball.

The game went to overtime, and the Bulls finally put the nail in the coffin of

reason, stopped playing and behaving themselves in a manner that was
unusual of them.

But behold, I say unto you, that I have not been trodden under foot, I have
not been cursed, and I have not been curseded.

But behold, I have sinned against my law, and I have lied unto my God.
Behold, I have lied unto my God; and I have done this that I might
bring shame upon my name.

Behold, I have taken the law of my father, and applied it to my own
iniquity.

Behold, I have lifted up the hypocritical audacity of the refiner of fine
wood, and I have advanced it a pace which has no end.

Behold, I have drunk from the cup of the lips of the man whom my
father hath given me, and I have committed sin.

Behold, I have committed sin because I have drunk from the cup of the
mouth of the man whom my father hath given me.

Behold, I trust that I shall be destroyed.

Behold, my soul is numbered among the things of no worth.

Father should command him that he should drink wine he should do it.
But behold, if he should command him that he should not he should
drink, he would not; but if he should drink he would not;
but if he should drink he would commit sin.

 34 And now, my son, I would that ye should know, that if the
Father should command him that he should drink wine he should do it.
But behold, if he should command him that he should not he should
drink, he would not; but if he should drink he would not;
but if he should drink he would commit sin.

Alma 15:35
 35 But behold, my son, this is in vain; for after God
had commanded him that he should drink wine he never could stop his
wanting.

Alma 15:36
 36 And now, my son, I would that ye should know, that if ye would stop
yourselves from drinking wine, and suffering your souls to be
baptized in the blood of the Lamb, and having received the
mark of the beast, which was given by the Holy Spirit, that
the blood of the Lamb should come forth from them in the form
of water--

Alma 15:37
 37 Having received the mark of the beast, which was given by
the Holy Spirit, and having a body like unto a river, they
should be full of water; having no form nor meaning, they
should be without end, for they were cuts and swells
without number.

Alma 15:38
 38 And after they should be cleansed from the body by fire
and by the shedding of fire and by the shedding of the
blood of the Lamb, their bodies should again be as the air
without number, subject even to the greater or lesser
of death--to be destroyed or to be raised to abide in the
potential of life.

Alma 15:39
 39 And they should be without pain or grief, without sorrow,
without hunger, and without thirst; having their joy and
happiness according to their wills, they being without
end, doing whatever was agreeable unto them; thus, in short,
equivalently as the air.

Alma 15:40
 40 Now, my son, I know that which I have written, according to
my words; and I know that thy words shall not be judged.
And now, my son, I would that ye should know, that if ye
should rebel against God, if ye should say that the blood of
the Lamb shall not come forth in the form of water, behold,
thy words shall be unchangeable.

Alma 15:41
 41 And now, my son, according to my words, ye may know that
if ye shall say such a thing, the Holy Spirit
shall cease from among you; but if ye shall say the same
thing, the Holy Spirit will show unto you that if ye
will not hearken unto his wordsfter God
had commanded him that he should drink wine he never could stop his
wanting.

Alma 15:36
 36 And now, my son, I would that ye should know, that if ye would stop
yourselves from drinking wine, and suffering your souls to be
baptized in the blood of the Lamb, and having received the
mark of the beast, which was given by the Holy Spirit, that
the blood of the Lamb should come forth from them in the form
of water--

Alma 15:37
 37 Having received the mark of the beast, which was given by
the Holy Spirit, and having a body like unto a river, they
should be full of water; having no form nor meaning, they
should be without end, for they were cuts and swells
without number.

Alma 15:38
 38 And after they should be cleansed from the body by fire
and by the shedding of fire and by the shedding of the
blood of the Lamb, their bodies should again be as the air
without number, subject even to the greater or lesser
of death--to be destroyed or to be raised to abide in the
potential of life.

Alma 15:39
 39 And they should be without pain or grief, without sorrow,
without hunger, and without thirst; having their joy and
happiness according to their wills, they being without
end, doing whatever was agreeable unto them; thus, in short,
equivalently as the air.

Alma 15:40
 40 Now, my son, I know that which I have written, according to
my words; and I know that thy words shall not be judged.
And now, my son, I would that ye should know, that if ye
should rebel against God, if ye should say that the blood of
the Lamb shall not come forth in the form of water, behold,
thy words shall be unchangeable.

Alma 15:41
 41 And now, my son, according to my words, ye may know that
if ye shall say such a thing, the Holy Spirit
shall cease from among you; but if ye shall say the same
thing, the Holy Spirit will show unto you that if ye
will not hearken unto his words, and dig a pit in the
earth, and let the water come forth without number, that the
potential of life might come forth, that the blood of the
Lamb, which is without number, might come forth without
defiance.

Alma 15:42
 42 For behold, the Holy Spirit cometh unto men according to
their words, to declare unto them things which are
prepared for them according to their desires; therefore, as ye
are, so are ye unless ye will repent.

Alma 15:43
 43 Now, my son, I would that ye would remember that the Holy
Spirit in the beginning was unchangeable; therefore, as ye
are, so shall ye be.

Alma 15:44
 44 And now if the Holy Spirit should be unchangeable, which he
is, or which he should become, it would be impossible for
me to state a thing from this time henceforth.

Alma 15:45
 45 But behold, I have written what I have written, and I
will write concerning you, to declare unto you the course of
the Lord's course.

Alma 15:46
 46 And now, my son, I suppose that ye remember that the
Lord said unto Joseph: Repent ye, and seek to be baptized in
the water?

Alma 15:47
 47 And now, Joseph, behold, I have told you this thing unto
you that thou mightest remember it unto the Lord, that the
Lord may bless you, and keep you, that ye may not perish with
the rest of the perishings of the flesh.

Alma 15:48
 48 Yea, Joseph, the Lord hath said it, and it is
preserved unto you in me. Now, our missionary labors were in vain,
and we were led away by the Spirit.

Alma 15:49
 49 Behold, the Spirit said unto us: Look! And in the
center thereof there is a man. Here he has the record of
our labors.

Alma 15:50
 50 And He said unto us: Look! And we looked, and there
was a man. But he was wild, and his skin was changed; yea,
he had lost that which had been in him, namely, the
sight.

Alma 15:51
 51 And he said unto us: This is the man; he is the
Man in the flesh.

Alma 15ords, and dig a pit in the
earth, and let the water come forth without number, that the
potential of life might come forth, that the blood of the
Lamb, which is without number, might come forth without
defiance.

Alma 15:42
 42 For behold, the Holy Spirit cometh unto men according to
their words, to declare unto them things which are
prepared for them according to their desires; therefore, as ye
are, so are ye unless ye will repent.

Alma 15:43
 43 Now, my son, I would that ye would remember that the Holy
Spirit in the beginning was unchangeable; therefore, as ye
are, so shall ye be.

Alma 15:44
 44 And now if the Holy Spirit should be unchangeable, which he
is, or which he should become, it would be impossible for
me to state a thing from this time henceforth.

Alma 15:45
 45 But behold, I have written what I have written, and I
will write concerning you, to declare unto you the course of
the Lord's course.

Alma 15:46
 46 And now, my son, I suppose that ye remember that the
Lord said unto Joseph: Repent ye, and seek to be baptized in
the water?

Alma 15:47
 47 And now, Joseph, behold, I have told you this thing unto
you that thou mightest remember it unto the Lord, that the
Lord may bless you, and keep you, that ye may not perish with
the rest of the perishings of the flesh.

Alma 15:48
 48 Yea, Joseph, the Lord hath said it, and it is
preserved unto you in me. Now, our missionary labors were in vain,
and we were led away by the Spirit.

Alma 15:49
 49 Behold, the Spirit said unto us: Look! And in the
center thereof there is a man. Here he has the record of
our labors.

Alma 15:50
 50 And He said unto us: Look! And we looked, and there
was a man. But he was wild, and his skin was changed; yea,
he had lost that which had been in him, namely, the
sight.

Alma 15:51
 51 And he said unto us: This is the man; he is the
Man in the flesh.

Alma 15:52
 52 Now we knew not such things at the time; therefore, it
came unto us as if it had been above us.

Alma 15:53
 53 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto us: The
man shall eat bread; and after he hath eaten bread he shall
be thirsty; and after he has drunk a cup of wine he shall
be hungry; and then shall ye return unto the Lord, and I
will go forth from thence into thy mouth.

Alma 15:54
 54 And it came to pass that we did as the Spirit
commanded us; and we did eat bread; and after we had eaten
bread the man said unto us:

Alma 15:55
 55 Eat; and then shall ye not be hungry, nor thirst, nor
be tired; but thou shalt hunger not, nor thirst not, and
he shall heal thee.

Alma 15:56
 56 Behold, I am flesh; and flesh is flesh, and spirit is spirit;
wherefore, flesh cannot be corrupted, and spirit cannot be
destroyed.

Alma 15:57
 57 And because of this he hath spoken the law, and it
is in my mouth.

Alma 15:58
 58 And again, the Spirit said unto me: Eat; and then
shall ye eat again; and then shall ye be full.

Alma 15:59
 59 And it came to pass that we ate bread, and then
we were filled; and then we were thirsty, and we did
not seek any more for water; and then we were hewn down, and
we were carried away down again to the earth, that the
earth shook at the last that we should be severed from the
chariots.

Alma 15:60
 60 And it came to pass that we were carried away in the
midst of the earth, that we were as the sand of the sea.

Alma 15:61
 61 And I, Nephi, saw the division of the earth, and the
appearance of mountains, and all manner of riches, upon the
face of the earth.

Alma 15:62
 62 And I also saw the glory of God, yea, the
hy, the
sight.

Alma 15:51
 51 And he said unto us: This is the man; he is the
Man in the flesh.

Alma 15:52
 52 Now we knew not such things at the time; therefore, it
came unto us as if it had been above us.

Alma 15:53
 53 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto us: The
man shall eat bread; and after he hath eaten bread he shall
be thirsty; and after he has drunk a cup of wine he shall
be hungry; and then shall ye return unto the Lord, and I
will go forth from thence into thy mouth.

Alma 15:54
 54 And it came to pass that we did as the Spirit
commanded us; and we did eat bread; and after we had eaten
bread the man said unto us:

Alma 15:55
 55 Eat; and then shall ye not be hungry, nor thirst, nor
be tired; but thou shalt hunger not, nor thirst not, and
he shall heal thee.

Alma 15:56
 56 Behold, I am flesh; and flesh is flesh, and spirit is spirit;
wherefore, flesh cannot be corrupted, and spirit cannot be
destroyed.

Alma 15:57
 57 And because of this he hath spoken the law, and it
is in my mouth.

Alma 15:58
 58 And again, the Spirit said unto me: Eat; and then
shall ye eat again; and then shall ye be full.

Alma 15:59
 59 And it came to pass that we ate bread, and then
we were filled; and then we were thirsty, and we did
not seek any more for water; and then we were hewn down, and
we were carried away down again to the earth, that the
earth shook at the last that we should be severed from the
chariots.

Alma 15:60
 60 And it came to pass that we were carried away in the
midst of the earth, that we were as the sand of the sea.

Alma 15:61
 61 And I, Nephi, saw the division of the earth, and the
appearance of mountains, and all manner of riches, upon the
face of the earth.

Alma 15:62
 62 And I also saw the glory of God, yea, the
howlings of his angels, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, art
baptized in the waters of baptism, and sanctified by
water, in the name of the Holy Ghost.

Alma 15:63
 63 Wherefore, thou shalt not withdraw thyself from the face of the
earth, until the wolf hath consumed the lamb which was
sealed with a stone.

Alma 15:64
 64 For it shall come to pass in the days of the wolf,
that he shall eat the flesh of the flesh, and shall lie down
among the grass, and shall lie down in the holes of the
rock, and shall eat the fruit of the tree in the waste
places of the earth.

Alma 15:65
 65 And thus saith the Lord God, most high God, the Eternal
Father, unto me: The wolf eateth the flesh of the flesh; and
his host shall return to him, and I shall carry them away
to my God.

Alma 15:66
 66 And it came to pass in the days of the wolf, that my
sons and my daughters and all the house of Israel were
wounded, that many were taken away to suffer the wounds
of the sword.

Alma 15:67
 67 And again, saith the Lord God, I have healed all their
sins; and I have taken away their afflictions; and they
have had no more death, as to the world; and their sins
are taken away.

Alma 15:68
 68 And now I write more concerning the healing of your
sins in my own behalf. Behold, I am the first and the
last; and ye must immediately send for the records which are
desirable unto me; for behold, they are preserved by the power of
the Holy Ghost.

Alma 15:69
 69 But behold, this is not all; for ye must return with haste
to the city Middoni, and the priest shall deliver them up unto
you.

Alma 15:70
 70 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly
sorrowful, and having had much fear, I spake many
things unto my father, Moroni, concerning the sufferings
of my people.

e
howlings of his angels, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, art
baptized in the waters of baptism, and sanctified by
water, in the name of the Holy Ghost.

Alma 15:63
 63 Wherefore, thou shalt not withdraw thyself from the face of the
earth, until the wolf hath consumed the lamb which was
sealed with a stone.

Alma 15:64
 64 For it shall come to pass in the days of the wolf,
that he shall eat the flesh of the flesh, and shall lie down
among the grass, and shall lie down in the holes of the
rock, and shall eat the fruit of the tree in the waste
places of the earth.

Alma 15:65
 65 And thus saith the Lord God, most high God, the Eternal
Father, unto me: The wolf eateth the flesh of the flesh; and
his host shall return to him, and I shall carry them away
to my God.

Alma 15:66
 66 And it came to pass in the days of the wolf, that my
sons and my daughters and all the house of Israel were
wounded, that many were taken away to suffer the wounds
of the sword.

Alma 15:67
 67 And again, saith the Lord God, I have healed all their
sins; and I have taken away their afflictions; and they
have had no more death, as to the world; and their sins
are taken away.

Alma 15:68
 68 And now I write more concerning the healing of your
sins in my own behalf. Behold, I am the first and the
last; and ye must immediately send for the records which are
desirable unto me; for behold, they are preserved by the power of
the Holy Ghost.

Alma 15:69
 69 But behold, this is not all; for ye must return with haste
to the city Middoni, and the priest shall deliver them up unto
you.

Alma 15:70
 70 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly
sorrowful, and having had much fear, I spake many
things unto my father, Moroni, concerning the sufferings
of my people.





THE BOOK OF MORONI

Moroni 1
Chapter 1

Moroni 1:1
 1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry many
words unto my father, Lehi, concerning the sufferings of my
people, the Lamanites.

Moroni 1:2
 2 For behold, my father, Lehi, had been kept back by the
Lamanites, that he had not tasted of the joy of the promised
land; even so he had been kept back by the Lamanites, that he
had suffered all things, yea, even death, which were affixed
unto his memory, even in the hope of that Zion which he had
desired of the Lord.

Moroni 1:3
 3 For behold, the Lamanites were upon the borders of the promised
land; therefore, after having suffered many afflictions of the
wicked, they were desirous that they might be brought forth
unto the promised land; therefore they were forbidden.

Moroni 1:4
 4 And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with his father,
because of the word which his father had spoken concerning the
coming of the Messiah.

Moroni 1:5
 5 Now Moroni being filled with anger, he did cry many words
unto his father, Lehi. And he also began to say many things unto
his father, in the which he was troubled.

Moroni 1:6
 6 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto his
father,
the words which he began to speak unto him, saying: Ammon,
remember, I am thy son, and have been brought forth by the power
of God into the presence of thy father, unto the soul of thy
father.

Moroni 1:7
 7 Thou hast not suffered the will of thy father, which is to bring
forth unto thee the record which shall be kept by the people
of the last and the second generation, according to the words
which are written.

Moroni 1:8
 8 But behold, hearken unto me, my son; for I say unto thee,
even as I said unto my father, that thou hast been
brought forth by the power of the record which shall be kept
of the holy prophets from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem, even to the time that he returned; for heit came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry many
words unto my father, Lehi, concerning the sufferings of my
people, the Lamanites.

Moroni 1:2
 2 For behold, my father, Lehi, had been kept back by the
Lamanites, that he had not tasted of the joy of the promised
land; even so he had been kept back by the Lamanites, that he
had suffered all things, yea, even death, which were affixed
unto his memory, even in the hope of that Zion which he had
desired of the Lord.

Moroni 1:3
 3 For behold, the Lamanites were upon the borders of the promised
land; therefore, after having suffered many afflictions of the
wicked, they were desirous that they might be brought forth
unto the promised land; therefore they were forbidden.

Moroni 1:4
 4 And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with his father,
because of the word which his father had spoken concerning the
coming of the Messiah.

Moroni 1:5
 5 Now Moroni being filled with anger, he did cry many words
unto his father, Lehi. And he also began to say many things unto
his father, in the which he was troubled.

Moroni 1:6
 6 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto his
father,
the words which he began to speak unto him, saying: Ammon,
remember, I am thy son, and have been brought forth by the power
of God into the presence of thy father, unto the soul of thy
father.

Moroni 1:7
 7 Thou hast not suffered the will of thy father, which is to bring
forth unto thee the record which shall be kept by the people
of the last and the second generation, according to the words
which are written.

Moroni 1:8
 8 But behold, hearken unto me, my son; for I say unto thee,
even as I said unto my father, that thou hast been
brought forth by the power of the record which shall be kept
of the holy prophets from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem, even to the time that he returned; for he beheld
that the records which were kept by the people of Limhi by
the hand of the Lord from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem, even down until the time that Noah entered
the ark.

Moroni 1:9
 9 And he also beheld that the people of Limhi also beheld
that the records which were kept by the people of Limhi by
the hand of the Lord were kept back from the time that Noah
entered the ark.

Moroni 1:10
 10 Yea, and he also beheld that the people of Limhi also beheld
that the records were kept back also from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem.

Moroni 1:11
 11 Now when Moroni had said these words, his heart did
immensely rejoice within himself, for he had imagined, because he
had been so hardened of heart, that the Lord would not be merciful unto
him, that he might not be delivered out of the hands of the
Lamanites.

Moroni 1:12
 12 But behold, it came to pass that Moroni was not so hardened of
heart.

Moroni 1:13
 13 But behold, the Lord was merciful unto him, according to his
words; and he did deliver him out of the hands of the Lamanites.

Moroni 1:14
 14 But behold, he did not deliver him out of the hands of the
Mormons; for behold, they were a remnant of the remnant of
the people of the people of Limhi, who were the people of Nephi.

Moroni 1:15
 15 And it came to pass that Moroni was desirous that he might be
translated into English; but behold, their chief judge had laid his
own hands on him, and he saw no way that he could recover.

Moroni 1:16
 16 And he looked to the Lord, and behold he was healed; for he
beheld that the Holy Ghost came upon him, and he saw all
things.

Moroni 1:17
 17 And it came to pass that he testified unto the people, his
father having first seen that the Lord had shown forth his
power, and then also his justice upon the people.

Moroni 1:18
 18 And he also testified unto those which he had not seen,
concerning the things which he had seen; yea, and he
testifiedy the people of Limhi by
the hand of the Lord from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem, even down until the time that Noah entered
the ark.

Moroni 1:9
 9 And he also beheld that the people of Limhi also beheld
that the records which were kept by the people of Limhi by
the hand of the Lord were kept back from the time that Noah
entered the ark.

Moroni 1:10
 10 Yea, and he also beheld that the people of Limhi also beheld
that the records were kept back also from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem.

Moroni 1:11
 11 Now when Moroni had said these words, his heart did
immensely rejoice within himself, for he had imagined, because he
had been so hardened of heart, that the Lord would not be merciful unto
him, that he might not be delivered out of the hands of the
Lamanites.

Moroni 1:12
 12 But behold, it came to pass that Moroni was not so hardened of
heart.

Moroni 1:13
 13 But behold, the Lord was merciful unto him, according to his
words; and he did deliver him out of the hands of the Lamanites.

Moroni 1:14
 14 But behold, he did not deliver him out of the hands of the
Mormons; for behold, they were a remnant of the remnant of
the people of the people of Limhi, who were the people of Nephi.

Moroni 1:15
 15 And it came to pass that Moroni was desirous that he might be
translated into English; but behold, their chief judge had laid his
own hands on him, and he saw no way that he could recover.

Moroni 1:16
 16 And he looked to the Lord, and behold he was healed; for he
beheld that the Holy Ghost came upon him, and he saw all
things.

Moroni 1:17
 17 And it came to pass that he testified unto the people, his
father having first seen that the Lord had shown forth his
power, and then also his justice upon the people.

Moroni 1:18
 18 And he also testified unto those which he had not seen,
concerning the things which he had seen; yea, and he
testified unto them concerning the things which he had
seen, even concerning the things of a past age.

Moroni 1:19
 19 And now I, Moroni, do not write all the words of
my father, which my father hath not written; for behold, he hath
written many things, and they are written in the book which
my father hath prepared.

Moroni 1:20
 20 But behold, I do write the things which my father hath
written; for it was for a wise purpose that my father hath
committed so many sins which he hath written.

Moroni 1:21
 21 And I, Moroni, do not write the things of my father, which
have not been written; neither will I write the things
of my father, which have been written by his own mouth.

Moroni 1:22
 22 But behold, I have written the things which my father hath
written; and it hath been for a wise purpose that my father hath
committed so many sins. And behold, I know that if my father had not
knew it, he would not have committed these sins.

Moroni 1:23
 23 Therefore, I do not write the things of my father, which I have
written, but they are written for the purpose that my father may be
caught, that he may know that he hath committed his sins.

Moroni 1:24
 24 And if my father knew it, he would not have bewitched my
father.

Moroni 1:25
 25 Behold, my father hath given me the books of the prophets,
and also many of the songs of the harlots;

Moroni 1:26
 26 And this I have written because it hath been a wise
purpose for me that I should write them.

Moroni 1:27
 27 And now it came to pass in the latter end of the nineteenth
year the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying:
Repent ye, repent ye, for the sins, and
whatsoever ye shall ask in the name of Jesus.

Moroni 2
Chapter 2

Moroni 2:1
 1 And now, this is the record which my father hath
written. I, Moroni, was born in the city of Middoni,
in the county of Joseph, and on yea, and he
testified unto them concerning the things which he had
seen, even concerning the things of a past age.

Moroni 1:19
 19 And now I, Moroni, do not write all the words of
my father, which my father hath not written; for behold, he hath
written many things, and they are written in the book which
my father hath prepared.

Moroni 1:20
 20 But behold, I do write the things which my father hath
written; for it was for a wise purpose that my father hath
committed so many sins which he hath written.

Moroni 1:21
 21 And I, Moroni, do not write the things of my father, which
have not been written; neither will I write the things
of my father, which have been written by his own mouth.

Moroni 1:22
 22 But behold, I have written the things which my father hath
written; and it hath been for a wise purpose that my father hath
committed so many sins. And behold, I know that if my father had not
knew it, he would not have committed these sins.

Moroni 1:23
 23 Therefore, I do not write the things of my father, which I have
written, but they are written for the purpose that my father may be
caught, that he may know that he hath committed his sins.

Moroni 1:24
 24 And if my father knew it, he would not have bewitched my
father.

Moroni 1:25
 25 Behold, my father hath given me the books of the prophets,
and also many of the songs of the harlots;

Moroni 1:26
 26 And this I have written because it hath been a wise
purpose for me that I should write them.

Moroni 1:27
 27 And now it came to pass in the latter end of the nineteenth
year the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying:
Repent ye, repent ye, for the sins, and
whatsoever ye shall ask in the name of Jesus.

Moroni 2
Chapter 2

Moroni 2:1
 1 And now, this is the record which my father hath
written. I, Moroni, was born in the city of Middoni,
in the county of Joseph, and on the borders of the land
of Nephi.

Moroni 2:2
 2 And I saw my father, by the power of the Holy
Ghost, sitting upon a throne; and he always had such a
great likeness unto him, that at the last he did not
remain upon his throne.

Moroni 2:3
 3 And the angel said unto me: Behold, I am the Lord thy
Lord; and I bring forth my words unto thee, thou hast
feared that I should speak.

Moroni 2:4
 4 But I, Moroni, did cause that thou shouldst write these
things unto thy people; nevertheless, thou shalt not write them
yet.

Moroni 2:5
 5 Behold, I speak unto the remnant of the house of Jacob,
for thou shalt not write them save thou shalt be translated, that
thou mayest prophesy unto this people the things which thou
hast prophesied concerning them.

Moroni 2:6
 6 Thou shalt write these things which I have prophesied,
according to the plainness which thou hast written.

Moroni 2:7
 7 Yea, these things which thou hast prophesied shalt thou shalt
write. Yea, thou shalt write the things which thou hast
rejected, according to thyself, in the book which thou hast
written.

Moroni 2:8
 8 But thou shalt not write the things which thou hast prophesied
unto thy people; for thou shalt not write them, except thou shalt
translate and cause to be written.

Moroni 2:9
 9 And I speak these things unto the remnant of thy people,
that they may know how to flee before the coming of the
Nephites, and also how to avoid them at the last day.

Moroni 2:10
 10 For as I said unto them, after they shall be scattered and
stolen away by the Lamanites, and after they have become extinct
they shall be built up again, and become unto themselves upon the
place which the Lord shall give them.

Moroni 2:11
 11 And the Lord shall say, Repent ye, for the Lord shall
hearken: and he shall bring forth his words unto the children
of men.

Moroni 2:12
 12 For after the Lord hath said this, thers of the land
of Nephi.

Moroni 2:2
 2 And I saw my father, by the power of the Holy
Ghost, sitting upon a throne; and he always had such a
great likeness unto him, that at the last he did not
remain upon his throne.

Moroni 2:3
 3 And the angel said unto me: Behold, I am the Lord thy
Lord; and I bring forth my words unto thee, thou hast
feared that I should speak.

Moroni 2:4
 4 But I, Moroni, did cause that thou shouldst write these
things unto thy people; nevertheless, thou shalt not write them
yet.

Moroni 2:5
 5 Behold, I speak unto the remnant of the house of Jacob,
for thou shalt not write them save thou shalt be translated, that
thou mayest prophesy unto this people the things which thou
hast prophesied concerning them.

Moroni 2:6
 6 Thou shalt write these things which I have prophesied,
according to the plainness which thou hast written.

Moroni 2:7
 7 Yea, these things which thou hast prophesied shalt thou shalt
write. Yea, thou shalt write the things which thou hast
rejected, according to thyself, in the book which thou hast
written.

Moroni 2:8
 8 But thou shalt not write the things which thou hast prophesied
unto thy people; for thou shalt not write them, except thou shalt
translate and cause to be written.

Moroni 2:9
 9 And I speak these things unto the remnant of thy people,
that they may know how to flee before the coming of the
Nephites, and also how to avoid them at the last day.

Moroni 2:10
 10 For as I said unto them, after they shall be scattered and
stolen away by the Lamanites, and after they have become extinct
they shall be built up again, and become unto themselves upon the
place which the Lord shall give them.

Moroni 2:11
 11 And the Lord shall say, Repent ye, for the Lord shall
hearken: and he shall bring forth his words unto the children
of men.

Moroni 2:12
 12 For after the Lord hath said this, the Lord God shall say
another, saying, Repent ye; for mine anger is still
eternal, and my wrath is still unpunished.

Moroni 2:13
 13 And the Lord God shall say, Repent ye, for I am the Lord
of Hosts, and I am avengering my people.

Moroni 2:14
 14 Behold, I will be merciful unto thy destruction, saith the
Lord God, and deliver the sword into thy hands of anger, and
deliver it into thy hands of fury, and of the most
fierce anger, which can no man tame, which is forever
and ever, to drive them away out of the land.

Moroni 2:15
 15 And the Lord God shall say, Repent ye, and I will be merciful
unto thy destruction.

Moroni 2:16
 16 Yea, I will be merciful unto thy destruction; for I will make my
slainress in the flesh, saith the Lord God, and I will make my
reproach unto my people.

Moroni 2:17
 17 And the Lord God shall say: Repent ye, for the Lord will
deliver.

Moroni 2:18
 18 And I will come down among my people, I will show myself unto my
people, even unto the gathering together of my people.

Moroni 2:19
 19 And it shall come to pass that they shall remember me not; and
they shall not remember the Lord their God.

Moroni 2:20
 20 And they shall be a scourge unto my people, and a
stiffness in their necks; they shall be a scourge unto my
people.

Moroni 2:21
 21 And it shall come to pass that they shall be taught by their
flesh, and by the spirit of prophecy, and by the spirit of
foretelling, all things which shall befall them as pertaining to that
which they should not have, as if they were contrary to the
knowledge of the Lord.

Moroni 3
Chapter 3

Moroni 3:1
 1 For behold, I have read the records of my fathers; and
the things which I have read, and also the things which
are written, are written according to the plainness of
my mind.

Moroni 3:2
 2 For12 For after the Lord hath said this, the Lord God shall say
another, saying, Repent ye; for mine anger is still
eternal, and my wrath is still unpunished.

Moroni 2:13
 13 And the Lord God shall say, Repent ye, for I am the Lord
of Hosts, and I am avengering my people.

Moroni 2:14
 14 Behold, I will be merciful unto thy destruction, saith the
Lord God, and deliver the sword into thy hands of anger, and
deliver it into thy hands of fury, and of the most
fierce anger, which can no man tame, which is forever
and ever, to drive them away out of the land.

Moroni 2:15
 15 And the Lord God shall say, Repent ye, and I will be merciful
unto thy destruction.

Moroni 2:16
 16 Yea, I will be merciful unto thy destruction; for I will make my
slainress in the flesh, saith the Lord God, and I will make my
reproach unto my people.

Moroni 2:17
 17 And the Lord God shall say: Repent ye, for the Lord will
deliver.

Moroni 2:18
 18 And I will come down among my people, I will show myself unto my
people, even unto the gathering together of my people.

Moroni 2:19
 19 And it shall come to pass that they shall remember me not; and
they shall not remember the Lord their God.

Moroni 2:20
 20 And they shall be a scourge unto my people, and a
stiffness in their necks; they shall be a scourge unto my
people.

Moroni 2:21
 21 And it shall come to pass that they shall be taught by their
flesh, and by the spirit of prophecy, and by the spirit of
foretelling, all things which shall befall them as pertaining to that
which they should not have, as if they were contrary to the
knowledge of the Lord.

Moroni 3
Chapter 3

Moroni 3:1
 1 For behold, I have read the records of my fathers; and
the things which I have read, and also the things which
are written, are written according to the plainness of
my mind.

Moroni 3:2
 2 For it came to pass after I had read the record of my
father the Lord commanded me that I should translate the
things which I had read, into the language which my
father had translated them; wherefore, I did translate, and
did make the records which I had seen into the Hebrew
language.

Moroni 3:3
 3 And the Lord said unto me: Thou shalt, in the which thou shalt
translate, have the book which is the record of my fathers,
which is the left book of the scripture, and also the
book which is the record of my father; wherefore thou shalt
have the books which thou hast translated;

Moroni 3:4
 4 And thou shalt seal up the remainder of them, which thou
hast translated, in the stone which thou shalt receive according to
your desire.

Moroni 3:5
 5 And behold, this is the thing which I desire of thee; and I
say unto you, that thou shalt receive in the name of the Lord
of Hosts; and if it so be that hearkeneth unto thee, he will
deliver it unto thee.

Moroni 3:6
 6 And now, I do not speak all the things whereby I desire
of thee; for thou hast spoken all the words of the scriptures,
saith the Lord.

Moroni 3:7
 7 Wherefore, thou shalt not suffer the children of men to be
translated by the power of the book, which thou hast
translated, unto them which are forbidden by the law, which
shall be kept by the holy order of the Lord.

Moroni 3:8
 8 And now, none of these things which thou hast translated are
of the law, by which thou shalt judge the children of men; for
by law all things must be done by law.

Moroni 3:9
 9 For by law is meant all obedience; and by law was the
conquest of the Lord made known unto our fathers, that
by law they must be obedient to God.

Moroni 3:10
 10 Wherefore, for all the commandments by which the
they were run, behold, the people were scattered among
them; nevertheless, they were kept from off the land.

Moroni 3:11
 11 And it came to pass afterd the record of my
father the Lord commanded me that I should translate the
things which I had read, into the language which my
father had translated them; wherefore, I did translate, and
did make the records which I had seen into the Hebrew
language.

Moroni 3:3
 3 And the Lord said unto me: Thou shalt, in the which thou shalt
translate, have the book which is the record of my fathers,
which is the left book of the scripture, and also the
book which is the record of my father; wherefore thou shalt
have the books which thou hast translated;

Moroni 3:4
 4 And thou shalt seal up the remainder of them, which thou
hast translated, in the stone which thou shalt receive according to
your desire.

Moroni 3:5
 5 And behold, this is the thing which I desire of thee; and I
say unto you, that thou shalt receive in the name of the Lord
of Hosts; and if it so be that hearkeneth unto thee, he will
deliver it unto thee.

Moroni 3:6
 6 And now, I do not speak all the things whereby I desire
of thee; for thou hast spoken all the words of the scriptures,
saith the Lord.

Moroni 3:7
 7 Wherefore, thou shalt not suffer the children of men to be
translated by the power of the book, which thou hast
translated, unto them which are forbidden by the law, which
shall be kept by the holy order of the Lord.

Moroni 3:8
 8 And now, none of these things which thou hast translated are
of the law, by which thou shalt judge the children of men; for
by law all things must be done by law.

Moroni 3:9
 9 For by law is meant all obedience; and by law was the
conquest of the Lord made known unto our fathers, that
by law they must be obedient to God.

Moroni 3:10
 10 Wherefore, for all the commandments by which the
they were run, behold, the people were scattered among
them; nevertheless, they were kept from off the land.

Moroni 3:11
 11 And it came to pass after they were kept from off the land,
and they had become estranged from the land, they began
to disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and began to doubt
concerning things which had been spoken by them by the
mouth of the prophet Zenos.

Moroni 3:12
 12 Wherefore, my father, Lehi, having been faithful and
fulfilled the law, he departed from it; yea, he departed
from the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 3:13
 13 And the Lord said unto me: If my son shall take upon him
this land, that he may live, he shall be brought by the hand of
the Lord to a land which is far away; and behold it,
yea, to a land which is neither tempest nor gloom nor
darkness nor day nor night; wherefore, my son, thou shalt hide
up the records, and they shall be kept by the Lord, that
they shall be kept and delivered unto the children of men.

Moroni 3:14
 14 And now I, Moroni, proceed to translate the records; for the
archaeology of the fathers hath made known unto us the
places of their encampments; and now, I would that ye should
know that they were in all the mountains and in all
oceans, and their valleys, and in all the
depths of the earth.

Moroni 3:15
 15 And I do not write the fullness of my saying; for it
cometh to pass that I shall write but a small part of my
sayings; nevertheless, it sufficeth me to say, that the Lord
cometh that they shall be delivered unto the children of
men.

Moroni 3:16
 16 But behold, there are records that are engraven upon the
plates of brass, which say:

Moroni 3:17
 17 Behold, I have seen this day, my son, and it maketh
me glad in my heart. Behold, it was the Father, I knew
that the Father had given me these things of his own accord,
because of the direction which he had taken of me in the
creation of the earth.

Moroni 3:18
 18 Wherefore, I know that the Father hath judged me,
according to the plainness of the records which are upon the
plates of brass; for behold, I know that he remembereth all
things both in heaven and inome estranged from the land, they began
to disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and began to doubt
concerning things which had been spoken by them by the
mouth of the prophet Zenos.

Moroni 3:12
 12 Wherefore, my father, Lehi, having been faithful and
fulfilled the law, he departed from it; yea, he departed
from the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 3:13
 13 And the Lord said unto me: If my son shall take upon him
this land, that he may live, he shall be brought by the hand of
the Lord to a land which is far away; and behold it,
yea, to a land which is neither tempest nor gloom nor
darkness nor day nor night; wherefore, my son, thou shalt hide
up the records, and they shall be kept by the Lord, that
they shall be kept and delivered unto the children of men.

Moroni 3:14
 14 And now I, Moroni, proceed to translate the records; for the
archaeology of the fathers hath made known unto us the
places of their encampments; and now, I would that ye should
know that they were in all the mountains and in all
oceans, and their valleys, and in all the
depths of the earth.

Moroni 3:15
 15 And I do not write the fullness of my saying; for it
cometh to pass that I shall write but a small part of my
sayings; nevertheless, it sufficeth me to say, that the Lord
cometh that they shall be delivered unto the children of
men.

Moroni 3:16
 16 But behold, there are records that are engraven upon the
plates of brass, which say:

Moroni 3:17
 17 Behold, I have seen this day, my son, and it maketh
me glad in my heart. Behold, it was the Father, I knew
that the Father had given me these things of his own accord,
because of the direction which he had taken of me in the
creation of the earth.

Moroni 3:18
 18 Wherefore, I know that the Father hath judged me,
according to the plainness of the records which are upon the
plates of brass; for behold, I know that he remembereth all
things both in heaven and in earth.

Moroni 3:19
 19 Wherefore, I know that the things which were
wrought among the children of men were wrought by the
Father and the Son.

Moroni 3:20
 20 And behold, I am commanded that I should write the
record which shall be kept and preserved by the Father and
the Son, until they shall raise up a prophet among the
children of men, and destroy the record which shall be
kept and preserved by the Father and the Son.

Moroni 3:21
 21 Wherefore, I know that the Father and the Son are one;
wherefore, I know that the Father and the Son are one God.

Moroni 3:22
 22 And the Father giveth the Son power, yea, even all power,
over all things which are in heaven and in the earth, and
which move or which are in the waters; and they which are not
move nor in the waters, which doth not comprehend all the
things which the Father hath prepared from the foundation of the
world.

Moroni 3:23
 23 And now I, Moroni, write the remainder of the record of my
father, which was engraven upon the plates of brass, for
they are vain and gone.

Moroni 3:24
 24 Behold, I write a few of the words of my father, which I
have said; for I have not written them all, nor hid up the
records which I have of my father, which he hath made
known unto me; which things are written in the books of
my father.

Moroni 3:25
 25 Nevertheless, I do write the words which he saith, which
are written in the books of my father; therefore I do write
them.

Moroni 3:26
 26 And I know that the Father hath said that he would give
these things unto my father; therefore I write them according as I
know not what to write. And behold, I know that the
Father will write them; wherefore, I write them.

Moroni 3:27
 27 Wherefore, I will write the words of my father; for he
tell me what he hath written; for he hath written them
concerning my father.

Moroni 3:28
 28 Behold, my father, Legs both in heaven and in earth.

Moroni 3:19
 19 Wherefore, I know that the things which were
wrought among the children of men were wrought by the
Father and the Son.

Moroni 3:20
 20 And behold, I am commanded that I should write the
record which shall be kept and preserved by the Father and
the Son, until they shall raise up a prophet among the
children of men, and destroy the record which shall be
kept and preserved by the Father and the Son.

Moroni 3:21
 21 Wherefore, I know that the Father and the Son are one;
wherefore, I know that the Father and the Son are one God.

Moroni 3:22
 22 And the Father giveth the Son power, yea, even all power,
over all things which are in heaven and in the earth, and
which move or which are in the waters; and they which are not
move nor in the waters, which doth not comprehend all the
things which the Father hath prepared from the foundation of the
world.

Moroni 3:23
 23 And now I, Moroni, write the remainder of the record of my
father, which was engraven upon the plates of brass, for
they are vain and gone.

Moroni 3:24
 24 Behold, I write a few of the words of my father, which I
have said; for I have not written them all, nor hid up the
records which I have of my father, which he hath made
known unto me; which things are written in the books of
my father.

Moroni 3:25
 25 Nevertheless, I do write the words which he saith, which
are written in the books of my father; therefore I do write
them.

Moroni 3:26
 26 And I know that the Father hath said that he would give
these things unto my father; therefore I write them according as I
know not what to write. And behold, I know that the
Father will write them; wherefore, I write them.

Moroni 3:27
 27 Wherefore, I will write the words of my father; for he
tell me what he hath written; for he hath written them
concerning my father.

Moroni 3:28
 28 Behold, my father, Lehi, left Nephi in the land of
Jerusalem, and he went not unto the mountain Shemlon because
of the people who were there.

Moroni 3:29
 29 He left his father, also, in the land of Shemlon;
wherefore Nephi returned again to the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 3:30
 30 And it came to pass that he returned again to the
land of Nephi; and after he had returned, he began again to
perceive the records which my father had kept.

Moroni 3:31
 31 And he began diligently to write; and it came to pass
that he began to write the history of my father, according to the
records which my father had made known unto me; and he began
to write the things of my father, and also many of the
words of my father.

Moroni 3:32
 32 And it came to pass that he wrote a few of my father
songs; for he did sing many things unto me, which were
unto me.

Moroni 3:33
 33 And I also remember the words which my father hath
spoken unto me; for the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as ye
shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; for
because of the diligence of your fathers, which have been
among this people, you shall be brought forth out of the land of
Shilom.

Moroni 3:34
 34 And now, my beloved son, Lyom, I would that ye should know that
inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments, even so I judge
you not; wherefore, ye must keep my commandments.

Moroni 3:35
 35 And now I, Moroni, proceed to write the record which I have
written, that the Lord God may know of his hand the things of
which my father hath spoken.

Moroni 3:36
 36 And it came to pass that after my father had thus
written a few of the words of my father, he spake many
unto me concerning the record which my father had
made.

Moroni 3:37
 37 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying:
Behold, I know that the things which my father hath
written are true; and whatsoever things are true, even the
thingsther, Lehi, left Nephi in the land of
Jerusalem, and he went not unto the mountain Shemlon because
of the people who were there.

Moroni 3:29
 29 He left his father, also, in the land of Shemlon;
wherefore Nephi returned again to the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 3:30
 30 And it came to pass that he returned again to the
land of Nephi; and after he had returned, he began again to
perceive the records which my father had kept.

Moroni 3:31
 31 And he began diligently to write; and it came to pass
that he began to write the history of my father, according to the
records which my father had made known unto me; and he began
to write the things of my father, and also many of the
words of my father.

Moroni 3:32
 32 And it came to pass that he wrote a few of my father
songs; for he did sing many things unto me, which were
unto me.

Moroni 3:33
 33 And I also remember the words which my father hath
spoken unto me; for the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as ye
shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; for
because of the diligence of your fathers, which have been
among this people, you shall be brought forth out of the land of
Shilom.

Moroni 3:34
 34 And now, my beloved son, Lyom, I would that ye should know that
inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments, even so I judge
you not; wherefore, ye must keep my commandments.

Moroni 3:35
 35 And now I, Moroni, proceed to write the record which I have
written, that the Lord God may know of his hand the things of
which my father hath spoken.

Moroni 3:36
 36 And it came to pass that after my father had thus
written a few of the words of my father, he spake many
unto me concerning the record which my father had
made.

Moroni 3:37
 37 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying:
Behold, I know that the things which my father hath
written are true; and whatsoever things are true, even the
things which have been spoken by the mouth of my father,
must needs be written down by the Lord, for he that is
promised the kingdom must keep his promise.

Moroni 3:38
 38 And now, behold, I do not write the things which my
father hath written, for I know that I cannot write them;
for behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should write them
down, that he may show forth his power unto future men.

Moroni 3:39
 39 And now, behold, I cannot write the things which my father hath
written; for the record is too long unto be written upon
plates; for the Lord hath commanded me that I should write the
things which I have written.

Moroni 3:40
 40 And the Lord hath said, that I should write these things
down, that he may show forth his power upon future men.

Moroni 3:41
 41 And now, my son, Lyom, I have written these things
that the Lord God may know of his hand the things of which my
father hath spoken; and also that he might prove unto me, that
by his word the twelve apostles of the Lamb had
concerning the twelve tribes of people who should hereafter
be scattered upon the face of this land; by the hand of
the Lamb they were scattered among all nations and
persons, kindreds, tongues, and people.

Moroni 3:42
 42 And the Lord God hath shown me, that whatsoever things
he shall command me to write, I shall write.

Moroni 3:43
 43 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, began to write the
record of my father; but I did not write the things which my father had
written; therefore, I did not write them.

Moroni 3:44
 44 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me that I should
write them; therefore, I did write them. And it came to pass that
the Lord commanded me, that I should translate the record of my
father.

Moroni 3:45
 45 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did translate the records
of my father. And I began to write the record of my father, which
contains the words of my father, and also many of the
words of his prophets.

Moroni 3f my father,
must needs be written down by the Lord, for he that is
promised the kingdom must keep his promise.

Moroni 3:38
 38 And now, behold, I do not write the things which my
father hath written, for I know that I cannot write them;
for behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should write them
down, that he may show forth his power unto future men.

Moroni 3:39
 39 And now, behold, I cannot write the things which my father hath
written; for the record is too long unto be written upon
plates; for the Lord hath commanded me that I should write the
things which I have written.

Moroni 3:40
 40 And the Lord hath said, that I should write these things
down, that he may show forth his power upon future men.

Moroni 3:41
 41 And now, my son, Lyom, I have written these things
that the Lord God may know of his hand the things of which my
father hath spoken; and also that he might prove unto me, that
by his word the twelve apostles of the Lamb had
concerning the twelve tribes of people who should hereafter
be scattered upon the face of this land; by the hand of
the Lamb they were scattered among all nations and
persons, kindreds, tongues, and people.

Moroni 3:42
 42 And the Lord God hath shown me, that whatsoever things
he shall command me to write, I shall write.

Moroni 3:43
 43 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, began to write the
record of my father; but I did not write the things which my father had
written; therefore, I did not write them.

Moroni 3:44
 44 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me that I should
write them; therefore, I did write them. And it came to pass that
the Lord commanded me, that I should translate the record of my
father.

Moroni 3:45
 45 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did translate the records
of my father. And I began to write the record of my father, which
contains the words of my father, and also many of the
words of his prophets.

Moroni 3:46
 46 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did put the record
together in a book, that I might write it hereafter.

Moroni 3:47
 47 And I did write it in the book of my father, which
contains the plates of brass; and I do write it in the
book of my father because I have kept them, even down to the time
that I wrote them.

Moroni 3:48
 48 And I do not write it in the book which contains the
words of my father; for I have kept them, even down to the
time that I wrote them.

Moroni 3:49
 49 But behold, I have also kept the law of Moses alone, which
concerning the entry and the passage of the sons of Mosiah
down from there down.

Moroni 3:50
 50 And if my father should write the things which he hath
written in the book, behold, I would translate them according to the
words of my father.

Moroni 3:51
 51 And thus it came to pass that I, Moroni, did translate the
translations of the records into English, that my father might know
that it was he that had wrought so miracles among the children of
men.

Moroni 3:52
 52 And it came to pass that after I had translated the
translations of the records into English, that he was desirous that I
should write the remainder of the record; for he being a man of exceedingly
high learning, he desired that I should know of the Lord what things
had happened unto his brethren.

Moroni 3:53
 53 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, being a man who had
brought the plates of Nephi unto my father, I found upon the other
plates which had been left by the people, a small record
concerning the kings and priests of the people of Nephi.

Moroni 3:54
 54 And after I had read the record which contained the
words of Nephi, which were written by him upon the other
plates, I found that I had somewhat of learning; yea, even I
did know the king and the people of Nephi, and also what
things my father had made.

Moroni 3:55
 55 But, alas! alas! I am a man of a much later date;
for I have yet to live;it came to pass that I, Moroni, did put the record
together in a book, that I might write it hereafter.

Moroni 3:47
 47 And I did write it in the book of my father, which
contains the plates of brass; and I do write it in the
book of my father because I have kept them, even down to the time
that I wrote them.

Moroni 3:48
 48 And I do not write it in the book which contains the
words of my father; for I have kept them, even down to the
time that I wrote them.

Moroni 3:49
 49 But behold, I have also kept the law of Moses alone, which
concerning the entry and the passage of the sons of Mosiah
down from there down.

Moroni 3:50
 50 And if my father should write the things which he hath
written in the book, behold, I would translate them according to the
words of my father.

Moroni 3:51
 51 And thus it came to pass that I, Moroni, did translate the
translations of the records into English, that my father might know
that it was he that had wrought so miracles among the children of
men.

Moroni 3:52
 52 And it came to pass that after I had translated the
translations of the records into English, that he was desirous that I
should write the remainder of the record; for he being a man of exceedingly
high learning, he desired that I should know of the Lord what things
had happened unto his brethren.

Moroni 3:53
 53 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, being a man who had
brought the plates of Nephi unto my father, I found upon the other
plates which had been left by the people, a small record
concerning the kings and priests of the people of Nephi.

Moroni 3:54
 54 And after I had read the record which contained the
words of Nephi, which were written by him upon the other
plates, I found that I had somewhat of learning; yea, even I
did know the king and the people of Nephi, and also what
things my father had made.

Moroni 3:55
 55 But, alas! alas! I am a man of a much later date;
for I have yet to live; and I am expert in the learning of
my fathers.

Moroni 3:56
 56 And it came to pass that after I had made the records
of the things which my father had seen, that my father
asked me concerning the plates of brass, and did preach them
unto the people.

Moroni 3:57
 57 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did preach the record
unto the people, that the records which were engraven upon
the plates of brass might be made known unto the people.

Moroni 3:58
 58 And it came to pass that after the people had read
the records which had been delivered unto them by the
prophet, who was the son of Nephi, they were desirous that
I should preach them unto them, that they might know concerning
the records which had been hid up in the earth;

Moroni 3:59
 59 That they might know concerning the records which had
been hid up in the earth, which had been delivered unto the
people by the hand of the Lord.

Moroni 3:60
 60 And it came to pass that I did exhort the people of
Nephi to look that they might know concerning the
records which were hid up in the earth; that they might know
concerning the people of Nephi, and also the records which had
been hid up in the earth from the beginning.

Moroni 3:61
 61 And it came to pass that the people were desirous that I
should preach these things unto them, that they might know concerning
the records which had been hid up in the earth.

Moroni 3:62
 62 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did preach them unto
the people; and I did exhort them that they should look upon the
records which they had hid up in the earth, which were
discoverable by the ancient people, and which were delivered unto
the people by the hand of the Lord, being written in the
record books which had been handed down from one generation to
another.

Moroni 3:63
 63 And I did exhort them that the records which had
been hid up in the earth should be made known unto the
people, that thereby they might profit thereby; and I
instituted a rule throughout all learning of
my fathers.

Moroni 3:56
 56 And it came to pass that after I had made the records
of the things which my father had seen, that my father
asked me concerning the plates of brass, and did preach them
unto the people.

Moroni 3:57
 57 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did preach the record
unto the people, that the records which were engraven upon
the plates of brass might be made known unto the people.

Moroni 3:58
 58 And it came to pass that after the people had read
the records which had been delivered unto them by the

 59 That they might know concerning the records which had
been hid up in the earth, which had been delivered unto the
people by the hand of the Lord.

Moroni 3:60
 60 And it came to pass that I did exhort the people of
Nephi to look that they might know concerning the
records which were hid up in the earth; that they might know
concerning the people of Nephi, and also the records which had
been hid up in the earth from the beginning.

Moroni 3:61
 61 And it came to pass that the people were desirous that I
should preach these things unto them, that they might know concerning
the records which had been hid up in the earth.

Moroni 3:62
 62 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did preach them unto
the people; and I did exhort them that they should look upon the
records which they had hid up in the earth, which were
discoverable by the ancient people, and which were delivered unto
the people by the hand of the Lord, being written in the

Moroni 3:63
 63 And I did exhort them that the records which had
been hid up in the earth should be made known unto the
people, that thereby they might profit thereby; and I
instituted a rule throughout all the land of Zarahemla, that
all the people should hear my words which I spake.

to return unto the Lord.

Moroni 5:4
 4 And it came to pass that I did preach unto them all,
and did cause them to return again unto the Lord.

Moroni 5:5
 5 And it came to pass that they did all return unto the Lord;
and it was by faith.

Moroni 5:6
 6 And it came to pass that I did preach unto my people,
concerning the atonement of the Lord Jesus, which was prepared and
saved the world.

Moroni 5:7
 7 And I did say unto them: Behold, it is he that hath redeemed
the world; and him shall the Son of righteousness be called in the
name of him who is able to save the world.

Moroni 5:8
 8 Therefore, my sons, it is he who shall call in the name of the
king of the house of Jacob; and the Son of righteousness shall be
called in the name of the son of Levi.

Moroni 5:9
 9 Therefore, my sons, as the Lord liveth, after the Messiah hath
beheld all the nations which were scattered upon the face of the
earth, after he hath made his ark, and stretched forth the heavens
in the face of the earth, behold, even upon the nations who were
scattered upon the face of the earth, shall the Son of righteousness
be called.

Moroni 5:10
 10 Now I, Moroni, did not write these things, lest some one should
discern them and destroy them; for I knew not at that time that
they should be preserved.

Moroni 5:11
 11 But behold, they have been preserved by the gift and
power of God, which is in me, notwithstanding the
transgressor; therefore I write them.

Moroni 5:12
 12 Therefore I write these things that the
words of eternal life should be fulfilled, which my
father hath written.

Moroni 5:13
 13 And it came to pass that after I had written these

earth, after he hath made his ark, and stretched forth the heavens
in the face of the earth, behold, even upon the nations who were
scattered upon the face of the earth, shall the Son of righteousness
be called.

Moroni 5:10
 10 Now I, Moroni, did not write these things, lest some one should
discern them and destroy them; for I knew not at that time that
they should be preserved.

Moroni 5:11
 11 But behold, they have been preserved by the gift and
power of God, which is in me, notwithstanding the
transgressor; therefore I write them.

Moroni 5:12
 12 Therefore I write these things that the
words of eternal life should be fulfilled, which my
father hath written.

Moroni 5:13
 13 And it came to pass that after I had written these
things, the disciples of Jesus came unto me, and desired
that I should tell them the things of Mormon.

Moroni 5:14
 14 But I was desirous to make the record which my father had
written; for I did not write them the things which my father had
written.

Moroni 5:15
 15 But behold, they said unto me: thou hast written them
the things which our father hath written, and thou hast
written them in the language of our fathers; therefore thou
shalt write them in our fathers' language.

Moroni 5:16
 16 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did write the things
concerning the three disciples whom Jesus should send among
the people.

Moroni 5:17
 17 And it came to pass that they were received by the disciples
of Jesus; and they were desirous to hear concerning the things
concerning them, and also the three little children of Jesus.

Moroni 5:18
 18 But I said unto them: The Lord knoweth that I have not written the
things which my father hath written; therefore thou shalt write them
concerning them.

Moroni 5:19
 19 And it came to pass that they came unto me and desired that I
should tell them the things concerning the three little children of
Jesus.

Moroni 5:20

things which my father had commanded me.

Moroni 5:21
 21 And it came to pass that they were angry with me, and they
sought me for the things which I had written.

Moroni 5:22
 22 And it came to pass that they were desirous that Jesus should
not return, for they were desirous that he should not depart from
his Father, even unto the Father, and testify unto them concerning
them.

Moroni 5:23
 23 And it came to pass that they were desirous that he should
not testify concerning them at the trial of the twelve; for
they were desirous that he would not testify concerning them,
concerning his father, and also concerning all the people.

Moroni 5:24
 24 For they were desirous that he should deny the Father, or
not know concerning all the people.

Moroni 5:25
 25 But I said unto them: Behold, I know this:
Concerning the three little children whom Jesus shall send
among the people:

Moroni 5:26
 26 After the three have been seen of the holywritten.

Moroni 5:15
 15 But behold, they said unto me: thou hast written them
the things which our father hath written, and thou hast
written them in the language of our fathers; therefore thou
shalt write them in our fathers' language.

Moroni 5:16
 16 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did write the things
concerning the three disciples whom Jesus should send among
the people.

Moroni 5:17
 17 And it came to pass that they were received by the disciples
of Jesus; and they were desirous to hear concerning the things
concerning them, and also the three little children of Jesus.

Moroni 5:18
 18 But I said unto them: The Lord knoweth that I have not written the
things which my father hath written; therefore thou shalt write them
concerning them.

Moroni 5:19
 19 And it came to pass that they came unto me and desired that I
should tell them the things concerning the three little children of
Jesus.

Moroni 5:20
 20 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did tell them all the
things which my father had commanded me.

Moroni 5:21
 21 And it came to pass that they were angry with me, and they
sought me for the things which I had written.

Moroni 5:22
 22 And it came to pass that they were desirous that Jesus should
not return, for they were desirous that he should not depart from
his Father, even unto the Father, and testify unto them concerning
them.

Moroni 5:23
 23 And it came to pass that they were desirous that he should
not testify concerning them at the trial of the twelve; for
they were desirous that he would not testify concerning them,
concerning his father, and also concerning all the people.

Moroni 5:24
 24 For they were desirous that he should deny the Father, or
not know concerning all the people.

Moroni 5:25
 25 But I said unto them: Behold, I know this:
Concerning the three little children whom Jesus shall send
among the people:

Moroni 5:26
 26 After the three have been seen of the holy Ghost, and
heard of the Father, and comprehended the mysteries thereof,
and proclaimed the word, behold, the Lord God will send a
little child among the people, yea, even a little child
concerning the three little children whom he shall send among the
people.

Moroni 5:27
 27 And the Lord God will cause that he shall speak unto the people;
for behold, the Lord hath said that Jesus shall raise him up at
that day; and he shall show forth his power unto him.

Moroni 5:28
 28 Now Jesus hath said that: When three are seen of the
Father, and heard of the Father and seen of the Son, the
Father sendeth a little child; and the Lord God shall show forth
his power in him; and he shall show forth his Father's
miracles unto the children of men.

Moroni 5:29
 29 Therefore, I know that the Lord God will cause that the Lord
Beheld my works; and he shall repay me according to my
treasures which I have done.

Moroni 5:30
 30 And now I say unto you, my brethren, that the Lord God
Hath said: I will show unto my little children that the Father
shall send me again; but I will repay my thanks unto the Father
nevermore.

Moroni 5:31
 31 And now I say unto you, my brethren, that I know of myself that the
Father will repay me my thanks; for behold, I am he which paid the
tribute.

Moroni 5:32
 32 Behold, I am he who is created of the dust of the earth.
Behold, I am he who was, and is, and ever shall be, and
ever shall enjoy the fruits of the flesh, of the blood,
and the wonderful works of the Father which are
contrived for the dead.

Moroni 5:33
 33 Behold, I am he who was slain by the enemies of my
people; behold, they who slew me am not dead, but they
who slew me am buried; and they are not even as I am, for
they have reposed their malice upon me, and I
am saved.

Moroni 5:34
 34 Behold, I am he of the tribe of Joseph; behold,
they were angry with me because I taught their
daughter what to do.

en of the holy Ghost, and
heard of the Father, and comprehended the mysteries thereof,
and proclaimed the word, behold, the Lord God will send a
little child among the people, yea, even a little child
concerning the three little children whom he shall send among the
people.

Moroni 5:27
 27 And the Lord God will cause that he shall speak unto the people;
for behold, the Lord hath said that Jesus shall raise him up at
that day; and he shall show forth his power unto him.

Moroni 5:28
 28 Now Jesus hath said that: When three are seen of the
Father, and heard of the Father and seen of the Son, the
Father sendeth a little child; and the Lord God shall show forth
his power in him; and he shall show forth his Father's
miracles unto the children of men.

Moroni 5:29
 29 Therefore, I know that the Lord God will cause that the Lord
Beheld my works; and he shall repay me according to my
treasures which I have done.

Moroni 5:30
 30 And now I say unto you, my brethren, that the Lord God
Hath said: I will show unto my little children that the Father
shall send me again; but I will repay my thanks unto the Father
nevermore.

Moroni 5:31
 31 And now I say unto you, my brethren, that I know of myself that the
Father will repay me my thanks; for behold, I am he which paid the
tribute.

Moroni 5:32
 32 Behold, I am he who is created of the dust of the earth.
Behold, I am he who was, and is, and ever shall be, and
ever shall enjoy the fruits of the flesh, of the blood,
and the wonderful works of the Father which are
contrived for the dead.

Moroni 5:33
 33 Behold, I am he who was slain by the enemies of my
people; behold, they who slew me am not dead, but they
who slew me am buried; and they are not even as I am, for
they have reposed their malice upon me, and I
am saved.

Moroni 5:34
 34 Behold, I am he of the tribe of Joseph; behold,
they were angry with me because I taught their
daughter what to do.

Chapter 1

Mormon 1:1
 1 I, Mormon, being about to write an epistle
to my father to mention the things which had been spoken by
the mouth of the prophets concerning the restoration of Jerusalem,
having been destroyed by the inhabitants of the land.

Mormon 1:2
 2 But behold, I have not written the things which my father
hath written; for hearkeneth to the spirit of prophecy and
also hearkeneth unto the spirit of revelation, which is taught
among some of our elders; yea, hearken unto the spirit of prophecy which
is taught by the prophets, which said:

Mormon 1:3
 3 The Lord will return again, O Jerusalem, thy king come forth out of
thunder; the Lord will make bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations.

Mormon 1:4
 4 And again: the Lord said: I will be merciful unto the
government of thy people, when they shall see eye to eye and
should unite against that which is unclean.

Mormon 1:5
 5 Behold, I am he who was slain by my people, for they
met a man in the wilderness and took him and carried him
away into the wilderness; and in the wilderness they sat
watching, lest by any means he should be lost.

Mormon 1:6
 6 Therefore, the Lord said: I will be merciful unto my
people, when they shall see eye to eye and shall
union with that which is unclean.

Mormon 1:7
 7 And it shall come to pass that the Lord said:
I am I that I am; therefore, the Lord God will make bare his
holy arm in the eyes of all the nations.

Mormon 1:8
 8 And it shall come to pass that the Lord will smite the
earth with a great and a terrible destruction, to the
extermination of his people.

Mormon 1:9
 9 But behold, I am he whom the Lord God hath
commanded me to write; therefore I write not the things of
my fathers.

Mormon 1:10
 10 But behold, all this is of my fathers; and there is but a
me because I taught their
daughter what to do.

Mormon 1:10
 10 But behold, all this is of my fathers; and there is but a
sting of mine am will and testimony of my fathers at this
time.

Mormon 1:11
 11 And there are other plates which contain my
father's engravings; but I will not write them, for I
will not engrave them in mine own hand.

Mormon 1:12
 12 But behold, these are they which I have written. And I
will show them, saith the Lord; and they shall be made known
unto his people.

Mormon 1:13
 13 And I, Mormon, have been commanded by the Spirit, to write
these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass; for
he that readeth them will know that I am he that meeth,
saith the Lord.

Mormon 1:14
 14 Behold, I am he that knoweth all things, that knoweth all
things both temporally and spiritually, that knoweth all the
concubines, and the captivity of their women, and the
persons, and the whale's doom, which shall come upon them
except they repent.

Mormon 1:15
 15 Therefore, saith the Lord, thou hast read the words of the
prophets; and the things which shall be seen among my people are
signified therein.

Mormon 1:16
 16 And behold, these things which shall be written shall be kept and
transmitted unto my people, as a testimony and a declaration of the
things which are to come; and also shall be given unto the children of
men, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 1:17
 17 Therefore, if my people repent; for they shall be heard
at the last day; for they shall be up before the Lord.

Mormon 1:18
 18 Behold, my son, I know that thou art a man whom man despiseth;
for me am I well pleased in thee.

Mormon 1:19
 19 But thou son of man, thou hast no life, and thou art lost; for
man never was nor ever can be saved till after the resurrection
of the dead.

Mormon 1:20
 20 Behold, thy days are past, and also all men; and thou art
exercised in the day of judgment, to teach the people.

Mormon 1:21
 21y fathers; and there is but a

earth.

Mormon 1:22
 22 Behold, I am the Lord thy God, who hath made thee a ruler over the
earth; who shall bring again to thee everlasting life.

Mormon 1:23
 23 Behold, I am the Lord thy God, who hath made thee a ruler over
the earth; who shall make thee fruitful, and to bring forth
again unto thee the fruit of thy loins; and after this manner
have I brought thee out of the land of Egypt.

Mormon 1:24
 24 For after this manner, after thou hast been a ruler over the
earth, thou art brought back into the presence of the Lord, and
is filled with the joy of his glory; for he hath pleasure in the
grooming of his flocks.

Mormon 1:25
 25 For after all this, and thou shalt have a testimony to
thyself, even as I have given unto thee, even so shall this
testimony be given unto thyself.

Mormon 1:26
 26 And behold, the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as my people
that camp round about me with all diligence, shall be
found in the wilderness; for out of the earth shall they be found,
if they be found not believers in me.

Mormon 1:27
 27 For the Lord hath said: I will raise up a prophet among you,
to declare good tidings unto you, that ye shall not perish out of
this time.

Mormon 1:28
 28 And it shall be a man whom ye shall call, yea, even thy
brother, shall arouse you from your sleep.

Mormon 1:29
 29 He shall say: Wake up, my brethren; arise, let us walk
together before the Lord.

Mormon 1:30
 30 And it shall come to pass that whoso believeth this boast,
behold, I am he that believeth.

Mormon 1:31
 31 Therefore, my sons, and my daughters, and all that are
with me, if they do not believe this boast, for they
maintain that I am not a God, behold, I am the Father
of Christ; and I am he that believeth in thee people.

Mormon 1:21
 21 Behold, I am the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee out of the
earth.

Mormon 1:22
 22 Behold, I am the Lord thy God, who hath made thee a ruler over the
earth; who shall bring again to thee everlasting life.

Mormon 1:23
 23 Behold, I am the Lord thy God, who hath made thee a ruler over
the earth; who shall make thee fruitful, and to bring forth
again unto thee the fruit of thy loins; and after this manner
have I brought thee out of the land of Egypt.

Mormon 1:24
 24 For after this manner, after thou hast been a ruler over the
earth, thou art brought back into the presence of the Lord, and
is filled with the joy of his glory; for he hath pleasure in the
grooming of his flocks.

Mormon 1:25
 25 For after all this, and thou shalt have a testimony to
thyself, even as I have given unto thee, even so shall this
testimony be given unto thyself.

Mormon 1:26
 26 And behold, the Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as my people
that camp round about me with all diligence, shall be
found in the wilderness; for out of the earth shall they be found,
if they be found not believers in me.

Mormon 1:27
 27 For the Lord hath said: I will raise up a prophet among you,
to declare good tidings unto you, that ye shall not perish out of
this time.

Mormon 1:28
 28 And it shall be a man whom ye shall call, yea, even thy
brother, shall arouse you from your sleep.

Mormon 1:29
 29 He shall say: Wake up, my brethren; arise, let us walk
together before the Lord.

Mormon 1:30
 30 And it shall come to pass that whoso believeth this boast,
behold, I am he that believeth.

Mormon 1:31
 31 Therefore, my sons, and my daughters, and all that are
with me, if they do not believe this boast, for they
maintain that I am not a God, behold, I am the Father
of Christ; and I am he that believeth in the Messiah, the
Son of God, and in the power of redemption.

Mormon 1:32
 32 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that I should make these
things known unto you.

Mormon 1:33
 33 Behold, I, having been a man, behold, in whom the
Father hath placed me; and the Father hath given me commandments
that I should make these things known unto you.

Mormon 1:34
 34 But behold, I have not found my purpose.

Mormon 1:35
 35 Behold, I am called Zoram, and the Amalekites he hath
commanded me to bring out of the land of Ammonihah; and I
am come unto you.

Mormon 1:36
 36 Behold, I am the son of Noah, and the father of two
babies.

Mormon 1:37
 37 Behold, I am a transgressor from the father; and the
Father hath commanded me that I should not bring forth all the
children that had been conceived; neither at any time hath he
commanded me that I should bring forth all the sons and daughters,
that had been slain by the father.

Mormon 1:38
 38 But, behold, I have found mine own children; and they are with
me. Behold, I am their father.

Mormon 1:39
 39 Wherefore, after my father hath made an end of speaking
concerning the redemption of his children, he waxeth
pious, insomuch that he revileth against the nations, and
their princes and their wives and their children, that he is
conqueror of the earth.

Mormon 2
Chapter 2

Mormon 2:1
 1 Hearken unto me, my son, and also the children whom my
father hath left behind; for he hath many sons and daughters; and
they know that I know that their Father hath sent me.

Mormon 2:2
 2 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that they have not; and
they revileth against them, and hateth them, and turneth them
away.

Mormon 2:3
 3 Thy fathers, and also thy mothers, and thy brothers and thy
sons, have all gone astray save they have behe that believeth in the Messiah, the
Son of God, and in the power of redemption.

Mormon 1:32
 32 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that I should make these
things known unto you.

Mormon 1:33
 33 Behold, I, having been a man, behold, in whom the
Father hath placed me; and the Father hath given me commandments
that I should make these things known unto you.

Mormon 1:34
 34 But behold, I have not found my purpose.

Mormon 1:35
 35 Behold, I am called Zoram, and the Amalekites he hath
commanded me to bring out of the land of Ammonihah; and I
am come unto you.

Mormon 1:36
 36 Behold, I am the son of Noah, and the father of two
babies.

Mormon 1:37
 37 Behold, I am a transgressor from the father; and the
Father hath commanded me that I should not bring forth all the
children that had been conceived; neither at any time hath he
commanded me that I should bring forth all the sons and daughters,
that had been slain by the father.

Mormon 1:38
 38 But, behold, I have found mine own children; and they are with
me. Behold, I am their father.

Mormon 1:39
 39 Wherefore, after my father hath made an end of speaking
concerning the redemption of his children, he waxeth
pious, insomuch that he revileth against the nations, and
their princes and their wives and their children, that he is
conqueror of the earth.

Mormon 2
Chapter 2

Mormon 2:1
 1 Hearken unto me, my son, and also the children whom my
father hath left behind; for he hath many sons and daughters; and
they know that I know that their Father hath sent me.

Mormon 2:2
 2 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that they have not; and
they revileth against them, and hateth them, and turneth them
away.

Mormon 2:3
 3 Thy fathers, and also thy mothers, and thy brothers and thy
sons, have all gone astray save they have beheld the Son of the
Father; and this is your cause; for behold, thou hast seen
the vision, and heard the words of the angel which he spake
unto you.

Mormon 2:4
 4 And behold, thou hast heard the words which he spake; and
seeing as they have not seen the Son of the Father, neither have they heard
the words which he spake, therefore they revile against thee and thee, and
them, and turn thee away.

Mormon 2:5
 5 And now my son, I would speak somewhat unto thee, which I have
morally required of thee; speak not the things which are
to come but the things which have been.

Mormon 2:6
 6 Behold, I am Mormon, and am the father of two boys; and
my wife and my two daughters are also sons and daughters of the
Father; and behold they know that the Father hath placed me
forever; wherefore, they know that I am a prophet of the Father; wherefore
they revile against me, and seek to destroy me.

Mormon 2:7
 7 And now my son, I would speak unto thee, touching the
things which I have seen with mine own eyes; that ye may know that
the Father hath not suffered my soul to see them, neither is my
soul any more able to write them.

Mormon 2:8
 8 Neither at times hath the Father commanded me to write the
things which had been, nor which are to come; but the
Father hath commanded me that I should write them; and he hath
commanded me that I should bear record.

Mormon 2:9
 9 Wherefore, I know that the Father hath commanded me that
these things should come unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:10
 10 And the Father hath created all things both man and beast; and
the Father hath given me commandments that I should write them.

Mormon 2:11
 11 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, took the plates of
which had been engraven upon the plates of brass,
and upon the plates of Nephi, the record of which had
been before the departure of the sons of Ishmael from Jerusalem.

Mormon 2:12
 12 And after I had made these thingsd, thou hast seen
the vision, and heard the words of the angel which he spake
unto you.

Mormon 2:4
 4 And behold, thou hast heard the words which he spake; and
seeing as they have not seen the Son of the Father, neither have they heard
the words which he spake, therefore they revile against thee and thee, and
them, and turn thee away.

Mormon 2:5
 5 And now my son, I would speak somewhat unto thee, which I have
morally required of thee; speak not the things which are
to come but the things which have been.

Mormon 2:6
 6 Behold, I am Mormon, and am the father of two boys; and
my wife and my two daughters are also sons and daughters of the
Father; and behold they know that the Father hath placed me
forever; wherefore, they know that I am a prophet of the Father; wherefore
they revile against me, and seek to destroy me.

Mormon 2:7
 7 And now my son, I would speak unto thee, touching the
things which I have seen with mine own eyes; that ye may know that
the Father hath not suffered my soul to see them, neither is my
soul any more able to write them.

Mormon 2:8
 8 Neither at times hath the Father commanded me to write the
things which had been, nor which are to come; but the
Father hath commanded me that I should write them; and he hath
commanded me that I should bear record.

Mormon 2:9
 9 Wherefore, I know that the Father hath commanded me that
these things should come unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:10
 10 And the Father hath created all things both man and beast; and
the Father hath given me commandments that I should write them.

Mormon 2:11
 11 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, took the plates of
which had been engraven upon the plates of brass,
and upon the plates of Nephi, the record of which had
been before the departure of the sons of Ishmael from Jerusalem.

Mormon 2:12
 12 And after I had made these things upon the plates of
bronze, which had been prepared in the days of Lehi,
(and it was soon after I had made them) I beheld, and
began to write the things which I beheld.

Mormon 2:13
 13 And I beheld that the things which I have written
were written in a manner that my father, Moroni, could no
more see them; wherefore, I have written them.

Mormon 2:14
 14 And I beheld that the things which I have written
are plain and pure; and none can decipher them, save it be
the Father, who seeth in secret; and he can show forth his
kingdom unto the children of men in many glorious
miraculous manifestations.

Mormon 2:15
 15 Wherefore, I take these things, which I have both seen and
heard, and they are written in a manner that my father
Moroni, by the power of his ministry, might be convinced of:

Mormon 2:16
 16 And it came to pass that I beheld the plates of which had
been written, and also the engravings upon them, which were
altered somewhat by the addition of the things which I had
seen and heard.

Mormon 2:17
 17 And I beheld that the things which I had beheld were
altered also; and the language which I had beheld was
transfigured according to the language which my father had
transfigured the language of the people.

Mormon 2:18
 18 And I beheld that the things which my father had
transfigured were translated by the power of the Holy
Ghost; and I also beheld that the things which I had beheld
were translated by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I knew,
knew that they were true.

Mormon 2:19
 19 And I knew that the things which my father had beheld and
transfigured, were not of this world; but that the Father, by
the power of the Holy Ghost, could show unto the
children of men all things, from the beginning of the world
even down to the coming of Christ.

Mormon 2:20
 20 And now, my son, I know that these things are true, for
they have been plainly declared unto me.

Mormon 2:21
 21 And I know that the Father hath shown them unto the
children of men;of Lehi,
(and it was soon after I had made them) I beheld, and
began to write the things which I beheld.

Mormon 2:13
 13 And I beheld that the things which I have written
were written in a manner that my father, Moroni, could no
more see them; wherefore, I have written them.

Mormon 2:14
 14 And I beheld that the things which I have written
are plain and pure; and none can decipher them, save it be
the Father, who seeth in secret; and he can show forth his
kingdom unto the children of men in many glorious
miraculous manifestations.

Mormon 2:15
 15 Wherefore, I take these things, which I have both seen and
heard, and they are written in a manner that my father
Moroni, by the power of his ministry, might be convinced of:

Mormon 2:16
 16 And it came to pass that I beheld the plates of which had
been written, and also the engravings upon them, which were
altered somewhat by the addition of the things which I had
seen and heard.

Mormon 2:17
 17 And I beheld that the things which I had beheld were
altered also; and the language which I had beheld was
transfigured according to the language which my father had
transfigured the language of the people.

Mormon 2:18
 18 And I beheld that the things which my father had
transfigured were translated by the power of the Holy
Ghost; and I also beheld that the things which I had beheld
were translated by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I knew,
knew that they were true.

Mormon 2:19
 19 And I knew that the things which my father had beheld and
transfigured, were not of this world; but that the Father, by
the power of the Holy Ghost, could show unto the
children of men all things, from the beginning of the world
even down to the coming of Christ.

Mormon 2:20
 20 And now, my son, I know that these things are true, for
they have been plainly declared unto me.

Mormon 2:21
 21 And I know that the Father hath shown them unto the
children of men; for I know that he hath said that: In the
first place, thou shalt have these things; and in the second place,
that thou shalt translate them in the manner that they shall
appear unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:22
 22 And now, my son, I have done all these things; and I know
that it shall be according to thy faith; for thou hast said that
I should show unto the children of men such things as these
things shall prove unto them, by the power of the Holy
Ghost.

Mormon 2:23
 23 And I know that thou hast said that these things should
come unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:24
 24 And it shall come to pass that when thou shall have these
things, thou shalt translate them in the manner that they shall
appear unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:25
 25 And behold, it shall come to pass that after thou hast
translated them in the manner that they shall appear unto the
children of men, that thou shalt be brought forth free from this
death, that the works of thy hands shall not be discovered,
neither by the power of the grave; but thou shalt live to see
ever the fruits of thy labors.

Mormon 2:26
 26 For behold, thou shalt have this gift, which thou shalt
give unto the children of men, which shall be delivered unto them in
the latter days according to their faith;

Mormon 2:27
 27 For thereby I know that thou shalt live until thou shalt repent
of the evil gift which thou hast received; for thus it shall be.

Mormon 2:28
 28 Wherefore, thou shalt not die; and if death should come unto thee at this
time, thou shalt at last live to behold the fruit of thy labors.

Mormon 2:29
 29 And now, my son, I know by this that thou shalt live to behold
the fruit of thy labors; and they shall be of great worth unto thee,
as well as unto thy children.

Mormon 2:30
 30 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these
things. For after I have spoken these words, my son, I
know that I must speak unto the children of men; for the
Father knoweth all things; for that: In the
first place, thou shalt have these things; and in the second place,
that thou shalt translate them in the manner that they shall
appear unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:22
 22 And now, my son, I have done all these things; and I know
that it shall be according to thy faith; for thou hast said that
I should show unto the children of men such things as these
things shall prove unto them, by the power of the Holy
Ghost.

Mormon 2:23
 23 And I know that thou hast said that these things should
come unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:24
 24 And it shall come to pass that when thou shall have these
things, thou shalt translate them in the manner that they shall
appear unto the children of men.

Mormon 2:25
 25 And behold, it shall come to pass that after thou hast
translated them in the manner that they shall appear unto the
children of men, that thou shalt be brought forth free from this
death, that the works of thy hands shall not be discovered,
neither by the power of the grave; but thou shalt live to see
ever the fruits of thy labors.

Mormon 2:26
 26 For behold, thou shalt have this gift, which thou shalt
give unto the children of men, which shall be delivered unto them in
the latter days according to their faith;

Mormon 2:27
 27 For thereby I know that thou shalt live until thou shalt repent
of the evil gift which thou hast received; for thus it shall be.

Mormon 2:28
 28 Wherefore, thou shalt not die; and if death should come unto thee at this
time, thou shalt at last live to behold the fruit of thy labors.

Mormon 2:29
 29 And now, my son, I know by this that thou shalt live to behold
the fruit of thy labors; and they shall be of great worth unto thee,
as well as unto thy children.

Mormon 2:30
 30 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these
things. For after I have spoken these words, my son, I
know that I must speak unto the children of men; for the
Father knoweth all things; for he cometh down from the
Father, knowing all things, and he hath given me commandment that
I must speak unto all the children of men.

Mormon 3
Chapter 3

Mormon 3:1
 1 And now, my son, I speak unto all the kindreds, and
nation, and tongues, and people, whom the Father hath
conferred upon me; and I speak unto every nation, kindred,
nation, tongue, and people, that they may know concerning
this thing which ye have been concerning.

Mormon 3:2
 2 But I speak unto all the ends of the earth; and the
Father hath given me commandment that I must preach unto all
this people, who are of the house of Israel, and who are
of the house of the Father--

Mormon 3:3
 3 Know ye not that I know all things of which I speak?
Yet ye do know that I speak unto all nations,
fiercely declaring war from that time forward.

Mormon 3:4
 4 And now I say unto you, do ye not remember that I said:
Know ye not that I know that the time cometh, that after ye
have established this church, after ye have read the scriptures
many times, diligently, and with one mind, ye will
receive them and apply them to your hearts?

Mormon 3:5
 5 And now I say unto you that if ye believe in me, or if ye
have read the scriptures many times, and have prayed oft
times, yet ye will not receive the things which I shall speak unto
you.

Mormon 3:6
 6 Therefore, repent and be baptized, for the remission of
your sins, that ye may be whiter, sweeter, and dyer, that ye
may be more valiant, enduring in the body longer, walking in
the strait path which is straight before the Lord, keeping the
counsel of the Lord, having a hope for the welfare of your souls.

Mormon 3:7
 7 And now, my son, I do not speak unto you to persuade you to
maintain your faith in me, for I am yet a minister of the
Gentiles; so I speak by way of exhorting you.

Mormon 3:8
 8 Behold, I say unto you, that after ye have received the
testimony of the Nephites whoknoweth all things; for he cometh down from the
Father, knowing all things, and he hath given me commandment that
I must speak unto all the children of men.

Chapter 3

Mormon 3:1
 1 And now, my son, I speak unto all the kindreds, and
nation, and tongues, and people, whom the Father hath
conferred upon me; and I speak unto every nation, kindred,

this thing which ye have been concerning.

Mormon 3:2
 2 But I speak unto all the ends of the earth; and the
Father hath given me commandment that I must preach unto all
this people, who are of the house of Israel, and who are
of the house of the Father--

Mormon 3:3
 3 Know ye not that I know all things of which I speak?
Yet ye do know that I speak unto all nations,

Mormon 3:4
 4 And now I say unto you, do ye not remember that I said:

Mormon 3:6
 6 Therefore, repent and be baptized, for the remission of

may be more valiant, enduring in the body longer, walking in
the strait path which is straight before the Lord, keeping the
counsel of the Lord, having a hope for the welfare of your souls.

Mormon 3:7
 7 And now, my son, I do not speak unto you to persuade you to
maintain your faith in me, for I am yet a minister of the
Gentiles; so I speak by way of exhorting you.

Mormon 3:8
 8 Behold, I say unto you, that after ye have received the
testimony of the Nephites who were in the land of Zarahemla,
and have been taught by the power of the Holy Ghost, who is
God, to know of the coming of our Lord, and also of his
conversion of the lost tribes--

Mormon 3:9
 9 Now the scriptures say: After this manner of language
shall the Lord confound my words.

Mormon 3:10
 10 And now behold, the Lord said unto Alma: Behold, I will teach my
people
these things; and behold they shall know concerning that which is
hitherto come.

Mormon 3:11
 11 And now it shall come to pass that the Lord said unto Alma: For
they shall say in the ears of all the people: The Lord hath
forgotten our transgressions; therefore it is according to the
means of our transgressions.

Mormon 3:12
 12 And again it shall come to pass, that the Lord said unto Alma: Behold, I
will show unto the world that the Lord hath forsaken me.
And again it shall come to pass, that the Lord said unto Alma: Behold, I
will show unto the world that the Lord hath forsaken me.

Mormon 3:13
 13 And now I will tell you of a manner of war which was
wrought among the people; for the Lord hath called them together
from the four quarters of the earth; and the Lord hath
confounded their words, and hath taken away the manners of
their speech--

Mormon 3:14
 14 Now it shall come to pass that there shall also come among
them those who shall say: The Lord hath forsworn us; therefore he
returned not unto us.

Mormon 3:15
 15 And again he said unto Alma: Behold these are the
manner of the languages of the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:16
 16 And now, there were not any who knew the language of the
People of the Lord among whom were the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:17
 17 And the people of the Lord hath he deceived; for they
are more learned than they that are in the land of Zarahemla,
yea, they are learned in all the languages of the
earth; yeater ye have received the
testimony of the Nephites who were in the land of Zarahemla,
and have been taught by the power of the Holy Ghost, who is
God, to know of the coming of our Lord, and also of his
conversion of the lost tribes--

Mormon 3:9
 9 Now the scriptures say: After this manner of language
shall the Lord confound my words.

Mormon 3:10
 10 And now behold, the Lord said unto Alma: Behold, I will teach my
people
these things; and behold they shall know concerning that which is
hitherto come.

Mormon 3:11
 11 And now it shall come to pass that the Lord said unto Alma: For
they shall say in the ears of all the people: The Lord hath
forgotten our transgressions; therefore it is according to the
means of our transgressions.

Mormon 3:12
 12 And again it shall come to pass, that the Lord said unto Alma: Behold, I
will show unto the world that the Lord hath forsaken me.
And again it shall come to pass, that the Lord said unto Alma: Behold, I
will show unto the world that the Lord hath forsaken me.

Mormon 3:13
 13 And now I will tell you of a manner of war which was
wrought among the people; for the Lord hath called them together
from the four quarters of the earth; and the Lord hath
confounded their words, and hath taken away the manners of
their speech--

Mormon 3:14
 14 Now it shall come to pass that there shall also come among
them those who shall say: The Lord hath forsworn us; therefore he
returned not unto us.

Mormon 3:15
 15 And again he said unto Alma: Behold these are the
manner of the languages of the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:16
 16 And now, there were not any who knew the language of the
People of the Lord among whom were the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:17
 17 And the people of the Lord hath he deceived; for they
are more learned than they that are in the land of Zarahemla,
yea, they are learned in all the languages of the
earth; yea, they know all the language of the people of
the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:18
 18 And it shall come to pass that those who know these
things who know the language of the people of the Lamanites shall
be hewn down and destroyed, that they shall not learn the language
of their brethren, the Nephites.

Mormon 3:19
 19 Therefore, the Lamanites shall be sent into the greatest
contention among all the people, and they shall be cut off from
among the people.

Mormon 3:20
 20 Therefore, Alma, and all those who were with him, departed
into the wilderness; and he returned again to the land of Nephi.

Mormon 3:21
 21 And it came to pass that Alma, by this means, received the
testimony of all the people who were in the land of
Nephi.

Mormon 3:22
 22 And it came to pass that the Lord caused that the people of
the Lamanites should gather together their people, the people of
Alma, who were in the land of Zarahemla, and be
converted unto the Lord. And thus ended the forty and
third year of the reign of the judges over the people of
the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:23
 23 And in the commencement of the forty and fourth year of
the reign of the judges over the people of the Lamanites,
Alma, and also all those who were present at the time that
the people of the Lamanites were brought together, to the
conversion of many people unto the Lord, and also many more
to the Lord, yea, to all those who were in the land of
Zarahemla at the time of their coming.

Mormon 3:24
 24 And it came to pass that he departed thence into the
wilderness, and began to teach the people of the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:25
 25 And it came to pass that he did preach to the people
who had been converted unto the Lord, every one according to
his tribe, every one having a place appointed for him.

Mormon 3:26
 26 And he began to preach unto all the people who had
been brought with the people of the Lamanites into the land of
Nephi.

M the language of the people of
the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:18
 18 And it shall come to pass that those who know these
things who know the language of the people of the Lamanites shall
be hewn down and destroyed, that they shall not learn the language
of their brethren, the Nephites.

Mormon 3:19
 19 Therefore, the Lamanites shall be sent into the greatest
contention among all the people, and they shall be cut off from
among the people.

Mormon 3:20
 20 Therefore, Alma, and all those who were with him, departed
into the wilderness; and he returned again to the land of Nephi.

Mormon 3:21
 21 And it came to pass that Alma, by this means, received the
testimony of all the people who were in the land of
Nephi.

Mormon 3:22
 22 And it came to pass that the Lord caused that the people of
the Lamanites should gather together their people, the people of
Alma, who were in the land of Zarahemla, and be
converted unto the Lord. And thus ended the forty and
third year of the reign of the judges over the people of
the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:23
 23 And in the commencement of the forty and fourth year of
the reign of the judges over the people of the Lamanites,
Alma, and also all those who were present at the time that
the people of the Lamanites were brought together, to the
conversion of many people unto the Lord, and also many more
to the Lord, yea, to all those who were in the land of
Zarahemla at the time of their coming.

Mormon 3:24
 24 And it came to pass that he departed thence into the
wilderness, and began to teach the people of the Lamanites.

Mormon 3:25
 25 And it came to pass that he did preach to the people
who had been converted unto the Lord, every one according to
his tribe, every one having a place appointed for him.

Mormon 3:26
 26 And he began to preach unto all the people who had
been brought with the people of the Lamanites into the land of
Nephi.

Mormon 3:27
 27 And there were many who heard his words; and they were
determined to hear the remainder of his words; therefore they
did hear his words.

Mormon 4
Chapter 4

Mormon 4:1
 1 And it came to pass that they did hear his words. And
they were changed from unbelief to belief, and from pride
to humility.

Mormon 4:2
 2 And they were also changed from wickedness to righteousness;
and from pride to holiness.

Mormon 4:3
 3 And they were also changed from pride to holiness,
yea, from pride to holiness.

Mormon 4:4
 4 And it came to pass that Alma, and all those who knew
these things, were angry with him; and they sought to lay
his record at the feet of Antipus.

Mormon 4:5
 5 But behold, Ammon and the two councilors and the priests
who were with him testified that they never knew when the Lord
would come, or what the Lord would do that he would keep the
commandments of the Lord, until the end of his day.

Mormon 4:6
 6 And thus they did testify. And they testified that they never
had known any more concerning the coming of the Lord, beyond
the words which had been spoken by Ammon, and also
the words of Ammon and his brethren.

Mormon 4:7
 7 And it came to pass that they did dispute among themselves,
yea, even till the reign of the judges had ended.

Mormon 4:8
 8 And it came to pass that they were about to destroy Ammon
and his records. But behold, Mosiah and his brethren said unto them:
Do unto us as we have done unto thee, O house of Israel, for we
are not already destroyed.

Mormon 4:9
 9 And now, O house of Israel, we know of a surety that the Lord
shall come, and our records shall be kept. And now, behold, we
know that the records which have hitherto been kept are
good; and we desire to know the reason why our brethren should
depart from us.

Mormon 4:10
 10 And they said unto Alma: Because they are not of the house of
Israel, they being of the housermon 3:27
 27 And there were many who heard his words; and they were
determined to hear the remainder of his words; therefore they
did hear his words.

Mormon 4
Chapter 4

Mormon 4:1
 1 And it came to pass that they did hear his words. And
they were changed from unbelief to belief, and from pride
to humility.

Mormon 4:2
 2 And they were also changed from wickedness to righteousness;
and from pride to holiness.

Mormon 4:3
 3 And they were also changed from pride to holiness,
yea, from pride to holiness.

Mormon 4:4
 4 And it came to pass that Alma, and all those who knew
these things, were angry with him; and they sought to lay
his record at the feet of Antipus.

Mormon 4:5
 5 But behold, Ammon and the two councilors and the priests
who were with him testified that they never knew when the Lord
would come, or what the Lord would do that he would keep the
commandments of the Lord, until the end of his day.

Mormon 4:6
 6 And thus they did testify. And they testified that they never
had known any more concerning the coming of the Lord, beyond
the words which had been spoken by Ammon, and also
the words of Ammon and his brethren.

Mormon 4:7
 7 And it came to pass that they did dispute among themselves,
yea, even till the reign of the judges had ended.

Mormon 4:8
 8 And it came to pass that they were about to destroy Ammon
and his records. But behold, Mosiah and his brethren said unto them:
Do unto us as we have done unto thee, O house of Israel, for we
are not already destroyed.

Mormon 4:9
 9 And now, O house of Israel, we know of a surety that the Lord
shall come, and our records shall be kept. And now, behold, we
know that the records which have hitherto been kept are
good; and we desire to know the reason why our brethren should
depart from us.

Mormon 4:10
 10 And they said unto Alma: Because they are not of the house of
Israel, they being of the house of Judah. For behold, the Lord
hath commanded our fathers that they should be kept in the
wilderness for the preservation of our seed, that they
should not have power over us, that they could not take away our
children and our wives.

Mormon 4:11
 11 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: Behold, the Lord
will make this covenant unto you, which he has made unto thy
father, which was a covenant and a promise; and he said unto thy
father: If thou shalt keep my commandments thou shalt be saved in the
end.

Mormon 4:12
 12 And it came to pass that Alma commanded his people that they
should search the records which had hitherto been kept by
their brethren.

Mormon 4:13
 13 And it came to pass that the people of the city of Noah did
search out the record which had hitherto been kept, yea, even that which
had hitherto been written by the people of the people of the
city of Jerusalem.

Mormon 4:14
 14 And after this manner were the words of Alma put to the
people of the city of Noah.

Mormon 4:15
 15 And it came to pass that Alma, the brother of Alma, said unto
them: Behold, I am a man, and am called Amulek; and for this cause have I been
called to declare unto you, my brethren, the gospel of the
Christ, which is preached by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 4:16
 16 And now, my brethren, I do not write all the words which have been
brought forth by the voice of my father; neither do I write the words of
ministers.

Mormon 4:17
 17 But behold, I have ministered unto the righteous according to
their prayers;

Mormon 4:18
 18 And I do write the words which have been spoken by my
father, which he hath commanded me to write.

Mormon 4:19
 19 For behold, he hath commanded me that I should preach the
word of God to all the people, which is written in the book
of Isaiah, according to the words which he hath commanded me.

Mormon 4:20
 20 And it came to pass that when I had taught the words of
my father, the people oford
hath commanded our fathers that they should be kept in the
wilderness for the preservation of our seed, that they
should not have power over us, that they could not take away our
children and our wives.

Mormon 4:11
 11 And it came to pass that Alma said unto them: Behold, the Lord
will make this covenant unto you, which he has made unto thy
father, which was a covenant and a promise; and he said unto thy
father: If thou shalt keep my commandments thou shalt be saved in the
end.

Mormon 4:12
 12 And it came to pass that Alma commanded his people that they
should search the records which had hitherto been kept by
their brethren.

Mormon 4:13
 13 And it came to pass that the people of the city of Noah did
search out the record which had hitherto been kept, yea, even that which
had hitherto been written by the people of the people of the
city of Jerusalem.

Mormon 4:14
 14 And after this manner were the words of Alma put to the
people of the city of Noah.

Mormon 4:15
 15 And it came to pass that Alma, the brother of Alma, said unto
them: Behold, I am a man, and am called Amulek; and for this cause have I been
called to declare unto you, my brethren, the gospel of the
Christ, which is preached by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 4:16
 16 And now, my brethren, I do not write all the words which have been
brought forth by the voice of my father; neither do I write the words of
ministers.

Mormon 4:17
 17 But behold, I have ministered unto the righteous according to
their prayers;

Mormon 4:18
 18 And I do write the words which have been spoken by my
father, which he hath commanded me to write.

Mormon 4:19
 19 For behold, he hath commanded me that I should preach the
word of God to all the people, which is written in the book
of Isaiah, according to the words which he hath commanded me.

Mormon 4:20
 20 And it came to pass that when I had taught the words of
my father, the people of the city of Noah repented not of their
iniquity.

Mormon 4:21
 21 And now I, Amulek, do write the words which my father hath
written; therefore I do write them.

Mormon 4:22
 22 For behold, it has been prophesied by the prophets, that after the
Messiah cometh in his own righteousness all nations, kindreds, tongues,
people, will mourn his death, that they may all stand before him, from
before the presence of his coming, to be judged according to their
sins.

Mormon 4:23
 23 And now my brethren, whether they shall live or die, that they may be,
according to their works, that they may be judged of their works, that
they may be cleansed from their old sins, that they may be brought to
stand before the bar of righteousness, that they may be judged by the
testimony of the Lamb, which shall appear unto them as a lamb
from the slaughter-place of the everlasting.

Mormon 4:24
 24 Behold, I am he. He shall manifest himself unto all the people in his
days. Wherefore, I write the words which my father hath written.
Behold, the Lamb shall judge the remnant of the house of Jacob.

Mormon 5
Chapter 5

Mormon 5:1
 1 Behold, now the righteous, they shall be gathered together.

Mormon 5:2
 2 And there shall be one study, and one law; for they shall all be
consigned, every one to his own place, from the beginning of the
house of Jacob.

Mormon 5:3
 3 And after the law shall be established among them, judges shall
declare their cause; for the statutes of the land shall be fulfilled which
are written.

Mormon 5:4
 4 And I will uphold my law, and my judgments, and my statutes; for
I am the Lord thy God, and my law is fulfilled.

Mormon 5:5
 5 Yea, I will establish my statutes, and my judgments, and mine
laws before the presence of the Lord thy God, the mighty God
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, one God under
his power, taketh upon him the form of servant, that he
be not all, but all may be made subject unto death,of Noah repented not of their
iniquity.

Mormon 4:21
 21 And now I, Amulek, do write the words which my father hath
written; therefore I do write them.

Mormon 4:22
 22 For behold, it has been prophesied by the prophets, that after the
Messiah cometh in his own righteousness all nations, kindreds, tongues,
people, will mourn his death, that they may all stand before him, from
before the presence of his coming, to be judged according to their
sins.

Mormon 4:23
 23 And now my brethren, whether they shall live or die, that they may be,
according to their works, that they may be judged of their works, that
they may be cleansed from their old sins, that they may be brought to
stand before the bar of righteousness, that they may be judged by the
testimony of the Lamb, which shall appear unto them as a lamb
from the slaughter-place of the everlasting.

Mormon 4:24
 24 Behold, I am he. He shall manifest himself unto all the people in his
days. Wherefore, I write the words which my father hath written.
Behold, the Lamb shall judge the remnant of the house of Jacob.

Mormon 5
Chapter 5

Mormon 5:1
 1 Behold, now the righteous, they shall be gathered together.

Mormon 5:2
 2 And there shall be one study, and one law; for they shall all be
consigned, every one to his own place, from the beginning of the
house of Jacob.

Mormon 5:3
 3 And after the law shall be established among them, judges shall
declare their cause; for the statutes of the land shall be fulfilled which
are written.

Mormon 5:4
 4 And I will uphold my law, and my judgments, and my statutes; for
I am the Lord thy God, and my law is fulfilled.

Mormon 5:5
 5 Yea, I will establish my statutes, and my judgments, and mine
laws before the presence of the Lord thy God, the mighty God
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, one God under
his power, taketh upon him the form of servant, that he
be not all, but all may be made subject unto death, that
also they may be made perfect in me, that they may be
brought to stand before the bar of the greater Eternal Judge
of Israel, for the greater judging of them and for the greater
bringing to pass the resurrection of the dead--

Mormon 5:6
 6 That all the ends of the earth shall know, yea, all the
ends of the earth shall see the resurrection of the dead,
and shall know concerning the fall of man; and the fall
of man shall be judged according to their works, that they may be
brought to stand before the bar of the greater Eternal Judge
of Israel.

Mormon 5:7
 7 And then shall the righteous be gathered together, every one
according to his works, from the
foundation of the world; therefore I say, the work of the righteous
shall be made manifest unto the children of men, upon the
pertaining to the death of the righteous, that they may know
that the grave shall come upon the innocent.

Mormon 5:8
 8 Nevertheless, as I have said concerning the captivity of
the children of men, in the days of captivity they were
pursued by the devil, to destroy the righteous until they
should have no more place at the right hand of the Lord.

Mormon 5:9
 9 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed them unto the fulfilling of
his word; therefore, they shall be gathered together, every one
according to the works which he hath done.

Mormon 5:10
 10 Therefore I say unto you, that after the Savior of the
world hath made his grave with the transgressor, he shall send
his Beloved among them, the righteous to redeem them,
that he may show forth his power upon them, that thereby they
might be lifted up at the last day.

Mormon 5:11
 11 And the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, one God under
his power, taketh upon him the form of servant, that he
may not all be one.

Mormon 5:12
 12 Behold, I am he; he shall manifest himself unto all
the people upon the face of the earth.

Mormon 5:13
 13 Wherefore, he worketh not among the children of men;
therefore he manifesteth himself unto the children of
 in me, that they may be
brought to stand before the bar of the greater Eternal Judge
of Israel, for the greater judging of them and for the greater
bringing to pass the resurrection of the dead--

Mormon 5:6
 6 That all the ends of the earth shall know, yea, all the
ends of the earth shall see the resurrection of the dead,
and shall know concerning the fall of man; and the fall
of man shall be judged according to their works, that they may be
brought to stand before the bar of the greater Eternal Judge
of Israel.

Mormon 5:7
 7 And then shall the righteous be gathered together, every one
according to his works, from the
foundation of the world; therefore I say, the work of the righteous
shall be made manifest unto the children of men, upon the
pertaining to the death of the righteous, that they may know
that the grave shall come upon the innocent.

Mormon 5:8
 8 Nevertheless, as I have said concerning the captivity of
the children of men, in the days of captivity they were
pursued by the devil, to destroy the righteous until they
should have no more place at the right hand of the Lord.

Mormon 5:9
 9 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed them unto the fulfilling of
his word; therefore, they shall be gathered together, every one
according to the works which he hath done.

Mormon 5:10
 10 Therefore I say unto you, that after the Savior of the
world hath made his grave with the transgressor, he shall send
his Beloved among them, the righteous to redeem them,
that he may show forth his power upon them, that thereby they
might be lifted up at the last day.

Mormon 5:11
 11 And the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, one God under
his power, taketh upon him the form of servant, that he
may not all be one.

Mormon 5:12
 12 Behold, I am he; he shall manifest himself unto all
the people upon the face of the earth.

Mormon 5:13
 13 Wherefore, he worketh not among the children of men;
therefore he manifesteth himself unto the children of
men, that they may know that he is he which is come in
the flesh; therefore, he worketh not among the children of
men, for he knoweth that he is he which shall come in the
flesh.

Mormon 5:14
 14 Wherefore, he worketh not among the children of men;
wherefore, he manifesteth himself unto the children of men,
that thereby they may know concerning the coming of the
Messiah, that thereby they may believe upon his name, and be
witnesses unto him at the great and last day, that thereby
they may be brought unto repentance and his righteousness.

Mormon 5:15
 15 And now I say unto you, that if the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, of whom I have spoken, and are manifested unto
the children of men, that they know that the Son, and also
the Father, are in the flesh, and manifest themselves unto the
children of men, that thereby they may be brought to the knowledge of
the covenants which they have made, which are with the world,
that thereby they may be brought to know of the covenants which
they have made, and be made known by the power of the
interpreters, that thereby they may be brought unto repentance and
of the Lord.

Mormon 5:16
 16 And now I say unto you, that if the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, of whom I have spoken, have not been manifested
unto the children of men, that they know concerning the coming of the
Messiah, that they cannot know concerning his righteousness save he shall
be manifested unto them in their language; nevertheless, he worketh
not among the children of men, for he knoweth that he shall not
be manifested unto the children of men.

Mormon 5:17
 17 Wherefore, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, of whom I
have spoken, are in the flesh, and manifest themselves unto the
children of men, that thereby they may know concerning the covenants which
they have made, that thereby they may be brought unto repentance.
cometh unto the Father only; for behold, the flesh is changed,
according to that which is in the flesh, the unclean things are
commenced unto the body, and the holy things are wrought upon the
flesh according to that which is done in the body.

Mormonth not among the children of
men, for he knoweth that he is he which shall come in the
flesh.

Mormon 5:14
 14 Wherefore, he worketh not among the children of men;
wherefore, he manifesteth himself unto the children of men,
that thereby they may know concerning the coming of the
Messiah, that thereby they may believe upon his name, and be
witnesses unto him at the great and last day, that thereby
they may be brought unto repentance and his righteousness.

Mormon 5:15
 15 And now I say unto you, that if the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, of whom I have spoken, and are manifested unto
the children of men, that they know that the Son, and also
the Father, are in the flesh, and manifest themselves unto the
children of men, that thereby they may be brought to the knowledge of
the covenants which they have made, which are with the world,
that thereby they may be brought to know of the covenants which
they have made, and be made known by the power of the
interpreters, that thereby they may be brought unto repentance and
of the Lord.

Mormon 5:16
 16 And now I say unto you, that if the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, of whom I have spoken, have not been manifested
unto the children of men, that they know concerning the coming of the
Messiah, that they cannot know concerning his righteousness save he shall
be manifested unto them in their language; nevertheless, he worketh
not among the children of men, for he knoweth that he shall not
be manifested unto the children of men.

Mormon 5:17
 17 Wherefore, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, of whom I
have spoken, are in the flesh, and manifest themselves unto the
children of men, that thereby they may know concerning the covenants which
they have made, that thereby they may be brought unto repentance.
cometh unto the Father only; for behold, the flesh is changed,
according to that which is in the flesh, the unclean things are
commenced unto the body, and the holy things are wrought upon the
flesh according to that which is done in the body.

Mormon 5:18
 18 Wherefore, the voice of the Father, which is in me, shall also
reprove unto the children of men; and their children shall be
converted.

Mormon 5:19
 19 And the flesh shall be restored to itself again, and shall be
wrought upon the hell of fire, the place forbidding men to be
converted.

Mormon 5:20
 20 And the Holy Ghost shall be given unto the children of men; wherefore,
the power of the Holy Ghost shall be given unto the father and his
children, that he may know of the covenants which have been made which
his fathers have made.

Mormon 5:21
 21 Wherefore, all these things are written unto my people, that
unto them may be fulfilled the words which were spoken by the
father unto them, and also that the father may know of the
covenants which his fathers have made which he hath made unto them.

Mormon 5:22
 22 Wherefore, the Father and I know of the covenants which the
father hath made unto them. The Father hath said:

Mormon 5:23
 23 Behold, I have given unto my people a commandment that they
should establish this people upon a throne in the land of
Jerusalem, even as I have made it a throne of liberty for my
people.

Mormon 5:24
 24 And the commandment also hath been given:

Mormon 5:25
 25 That none other people in the whole earth should so much as look
at them, until the time cometh that they shall lift up their eyes
unto the heavens and shall see the face of the Lord.

Mormon 5:26
 26 And then cometh the Lord their God; then shall they see the
face of the Lord; and they shall rejoice in that same day, for
they shall be lifted up at the last day; for they shall be
consumed by fire, and shall be consumed by the flames of
that awful abyss; and none shall escape.

Mormon 5:27
 27 And only the righteous, and the true hope of the Lord,
shall be preserved by them; and he shall set his hand
again the second time to recover them.

Mormon 5:28
 28 Wherefore, my people, and also all the house of Israel,
and also all theding to that which is done in the body.

Mormon 5:18
 18 Wherefore, the voice of the Father, which is in me, shall also
reprove unto the children of men; and their children shall be
converted.

Mormon 5:19
 19 And the flesh shall be restored to itself again, and shall be
wrought upon the hell of fire, the place forbidding men to be
converted.

Mormon 5:20
 20 And the Holy Ghost shall be given unto the children of men; wherefore,
the power of the Holy Ghost shall be given unto the father and his
children, that he may know of the covenants which have been made which
his fathers have made.

Mormon 5:21
 21 Wherefore, all these things are written unto my people, that
unto them may be fulfilled the words which were spoken by the
father unto them, and also that the father may know of the
covenants which his fathers have made which he hath made unto them.

Mormon 5:22
 22 Wherefore, the Father and I know of the covenants which the
father hath made unto them. The Father hath said:

Mormon 5:23
 23 Behold, I have given unto my people a commandment that they
should establish this people upon a throne in the land of
Jerusalem, even as I have made it a throne of liberty for my
people.

Mormon 5:24
 24 And the commandment also hath been given:

Mormon 5:25
 25 That none other people in the whole earth should so much as look
at them, until the time cometh that they shall lift up their eyes
unto the heavens and shall see the face of the Lord.

Mormon 5:26
 26 And then cometh the Lord their God; then shall they see the
face of the Lord; and they shall rejoice in that same day, for
they shall be lifted up at the last day; for they shall be
consumed by fire, and shall be consumed by the flames of
that awful abyss; and none shall escape.

Mormon 5:27
 27 And only the righteous, and the true hope of the Lord,
shall be preserved by them; and he shall set his hand
again the second time to recover them.

Mormon 5:28
 28 Wherefore, my people, and also all the house of Israel,
and also all the house of the nations which are under the heavens,
shall be gathered together in one, to stand before the bar of
God, to be judged according to that which they have done.

Mormon 5:29
 29 And then will I remember the covenant which I have made
unto you; and then will I remember that which I have done
to your fathers; for they were a stiffnecked people,
unto whom the Lord turned his words. Wherefore, I
say unto you that they shall be judged according to their
acts.

Mormon 5:30
 30 Therefore remember, my son, that I have made a covenant
with my people; that I have sworn unto you, O house of Israel,
that I would be merciful unto my people, if ye should render
to the place of his rest, that the Holy One of Israel may
rejoice in you, even as he has blessed my people.

Mormon 5:31
 31 And then also thou shalt know that I have made a covenant with
my people; and it shall be made known unto thee, that thou
art not alone, but also all the house of Israel shall know that I
am the Lord thy God, thou shalt see me as I am, before the
face of the earth; and then shalt thou also know of the
cross that is before thee, and the shame that is upon thy mother's
shoulder.

Mormon 5:32
 32 I am he; thou shalt have no other name given among this people;
therefore, thou shalt be called thy name. Yea, thou shalt be called
thy name.

Mormon 5:33
 33 And all mankind which are not a member of this people will I
be, and there is none other.

Mormon 5:34
 34 I am he; thou shalt have no other name given among this people;
therefore, thou shalt be called thy name. Yea, thou shalt be
called thy name.

Mormon 5:35
 35 And now, my son, I know of a surety that thou art made
of this rock, and this hard stuff; and I know that it is
hardness; for there is none other thing which I know of
which there can be no resistance, save it beMormon 5:28
 28 Wherefore, my people, and also all the house of Israel,
and also all the house of the nations which are under the heavens,
shall be gathered together in one, to stand before the bar of
God, to be judged according to that which they have done.

Mormon 5:29
 29 And then will I remember the covenant which I have made
unto you; and then will I remember that which I have done
to your fathers; for they were a stiffnecked people,
unto whom the Lord turned his words. Wherefore, I
say unto you that they shall be judged according to their
acts.

Mormon 5:30
 30 Therefore remember, my son, that I have made a covenant
with my people; that I have sworn unto you, O house of Israel,
that I would be merciful unto my people, if ye should render
to the place of his rest, that the Holy One of Israel may
rejoice in you, even as he has blessed my people.

Mormon 5:31
 31 And then also thou shalt know that I have made a covenant with
my people; and it shall be made known unto thee, that thou
art not alone, but also all the house of Israel shall know that I
am the Lord thy God, thou shalt see me as I am, before the
face of the earth; and then shalt thou also know of the
cross that is before thee, and the shame that is upon thy mother's
shoulder.

Mormon 5:32
 32 I am he; thou shalt have no other name given among this people;
therefore, thou shalt be called thy name. Yea, thou shalt be called
thy name.

Mormon 5:33
 33 And all mankind which are not a member of this people will I
be, and there is none other.

Mormon 5:34
 34 I am he; thou shalt have no other name given among this people;
therefore, thou shalt be called thy name. Yea, thou shalt be
called thy name.

Mormon 5:35
 35 And now, my son, I know of a surety that thou art made
of this rock, and this hard stuff; and I know that it is
hardness; for there is none other thing which I know of
which there can be no resistance, save it be the hardness of the
rock; wherefore, the Holy One of Israel hath said:

Mormon 5:36
 36 The Lord hath made me a stiffnecked people, that I must be
driven by the anger of the Lord. For the Lord hath said:
Mormon 5:37
 37 Give unto a stiffnecked people a stumble; yea, and I will
grant unto them a breaking in at the last day.

Mormon 5:38
 38 The Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as a man will not hearken
unto his own voice, he cannot be saved.

Mormon 5:39
 39 And again: If a man have a son, and hate his father, the
day that the father shall raise up a protest against his voice, the
father will lose his voice; for he hath no one to give praise to
his voice.

Mormon 5:40
 40 Therefore the Lord hath said: Inasmuch as a man will not hearken
unto his own voice, he cannot be saved.

Mormon 5:41
 41 And again: If a man shall say to his son--Behold, who hath
made this thing for us?--Behold, I have not, the Lord hath
said--Behold I have not, etc.

Mormon 5:42
 42 The Lord hath not command any man that shall speak these
things, but he hath given me a commandment that I should preach them
unto the people; and I have done that which the Lord hath
commanded me.

Mormon 5:43
 43 And I have brought the parable of the good shepherd along
with me, which is, if the shepherd hateh his sheep, the sheep
shall return to their own house.

Mormon 5:44
 44 Now I say unto you that the good shepherd will not forsake thee,
but he will give thee a name that thou shall no more use
thou's voice in the streets, nor in the places of worship; for he
shall be called of his father;

Mormon 5:45
 45 He is he who did feed thy sheep; he is he who did
sit by thee, and by thy side; he is he who did take away the
burden; etc.

Mormon 5:46
ess; for there is none other thing which I know of
which there can be no resistance, save it be the hardness of the
rock; wherefore, the Holy One of Israel hath said:

Mormon 5:36
 36 The Lord hath made me a stiffnecked people, that I must be
driven by the anger of the Lord. For the Lord hath said:
Mormon 5:37
 37 Give unto a stiffnecked people a stumble; yea, and I will
grant unto them a breaking in at the last day.

Mormon 5:38
 38 The Lord hath said that: Inasmuch as a man will not hearken
unto his own voice, he cannot be saved.

Mormon 5:39
 39 And again: If a man have a son, and hate his father, the
day that the father shall raise up a protest against his voice, the
father will lose his voice; for he hath no one to give praise to
his voice.

Mormon 5:40
 40 Therefore the Lord hath said: Inasmuch as a man will not hearken
unto his own voice, he cannot be saved.

Mormon 5:41
 41 And again: If a man shall say to his son--Behold, who hath
made this thing for us?--Behold, I have not, the Lord hath
said--Behold I have not, etc.

Mormon 5:42
 42 The Lord hath not command any man that shall speak these
things, but he hath given me a commandment that I should preach them
unto the people; and I have done that which the Lord hath
commanded me.

Mormon 5:43
 43 And I have brought the parable of the good shepherd along
with me, which is, if the shepherd hateh his sheep, the sheep
shall return to their own house.

Mormon 5:44
 44 Now I say unto you that the good shepherd will not forsake thee,
but he will give thee a name that thou shall no more use
thou's voice in the streets, nor in the places of worship; for he
shall be called of his father;

Mormon 5:45
 45 He is he who did feed thy sheep; he is he who did
sit by thee, and by thy side; he is he who did take away the
burden; etc.

Mormon 5:46
 46 But this is he of whom I speak, which is the shepherd;
for him are all the sheep of the sheep-herding house; he is the
he who hath fed thee, and hast fed thee, and hast made thee
oath by the wind to return; therefore, thou shalt not
fret thyself.

Mormon 5:47
 47 Therefore, whoso among thy sheep shall be found not, the same
shall be cut off from thy flock.

Mormon 5:48
 48 The one among thy sheep, to him will I given the
name; and he shall be called by thy name; and thou shalt
not raise up a complaint against him, nor shall he
make much fuss.

Mormon 5:49
 49 The other, to him shall I give the name of my lamb; and
whoso among thy brethren shall be found not, the same shall
be cut off from thy flock.

Mormon 5:50
 50 Therefore, whoso among the sheep of my sheep shall be
found not, that he be not numbered among my sheep, that he
be not numbered among the sheep of my people.

Mormon 5:51
 51 And whoso among my sheep shall be found not, the same
shall be cut off from among the people.

Mormon 5:52
 52 Therefore, the Lord will appoint a way for my people and
him who are with me; and it shall be a wonderful way;
wherefore, the Lord God will show no mercy upon the wicked.

Mormon 5:53
 53 Behold, I am he who hideth the plates of brass, and layeth
them with them, that I may preserve them for the people.

Mormon 5:54
 54 Behold, I am he who hideth the plates of brass, and
pursuereth them not them, neither do I write them; but I
preserve them for the people; therefore, I do write them
unto the people which are of the house of Israel.

Mormon 5:55
 55 Behold, I am he that returned the record of
my people, and wrote it; and I am he that beareth the
record, that keepeth it continually before him.

Mormon 5:56
 56 And take away the
burden; etc.

Mormon 5:46
 46 But this is he of whom I speak, which is the shepherd;
for him are all the sheep of the sheep-herding house; he is the
he who hath fed thee, and hast fed thee, and hast made thee
oath by the wind to return; therefore, thou shalt not
fret thyself.

Mormon 5:47
 47 Therefore, whoso among thy sheep shall be found not, the same
shall be cut off from thy flock.

Mormon 5:48
 48 The one among thy sheep, to him will I given the
name; and he shall be called by thy name; and thou shalt
not raise up a complaint against him, nor shall he
make much fuss.

Mormon 5:49
 49 The other, to him shall I give the name of my lamb; and
whoso among thy brethren shall be found not, the same shall
be cut off from thy flock.

Mormon 5:50
 50 Therefore, whoso among the sheep of my sheep shall be
found not, that he be not numbered among my sheep, that he
be not numbered among the sheep of my people.

Mormon 5:51
 51 And whoso among my sheep shall be found not, the same
shall be cut off from among the people.

Mormon 5:52
 52 Therefore, the Lord will appoint a way for my people and
him who are with me; and it shall be a wonderful way;
wherefore, the Lord God will show no mercy upon the wicked.

Mormon 5:53
 53 Behold, I am he who hideth the plates of brass, and layeth
them with them, that I may preserve them for the people.

Mormon 5:54
 54 Behold, I am he who hideth the plates of brass, and
pursuereth them not them, neither do I write them; but I
preserve them for the people; therefore, I do write them
unto the people which are of the house of Israel.

Mormon 5:55
 55 Behold, I am he that returned the record of
my people, and wrote it; and I am he that beareth the
record, that keepeth it continually before him.

Mormon 5:56
 56 And it came to pass that I wrote many things
concerning my people, which I have not written in this book.

Mormon 5:57
 57 But I have written many things which are written in my
memoirs, which shall be hereafter written, for some
many days yet cometh, and these shall be written according to
my words.

Mormon 5:58
 58 And when these shall be written, the heavens shall
pale; and utter darkness shall shake, and the earth shall
be rent asunder, and the inhabitants shall flee; for the
judgment-seat of the Lord hath judged me, and he
hath given me authority over the land.

Mormon 5:59
 59 For the Lord said unto me: If I had not commanded my
people, they would have been lost from the face of the earth. But
I have commanded my people, they have been lost. For out of the
promise land have I created them; therefore, I know them.

Mormon 5:60
 60 Behold, I know of the covenant which has been made between
the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which is a
brethrenship; therefore, it shall be a blessing upon them.

Mormon 5:61
 61 Nevertheless, the Lord hath said that I know them not; nevertheless,
he hath commanded me that I should write this record, and that I
should seal it up.

Mormon 5:62
 62 But I have not written it, neither have I read it; but it
shall be kept and preserved by the remnant of the house of
Israel, that they shall not perish, that the land of their
return may be as a forest, prepared by the Lord and his
children, for their transgression and their iniquity.

Mormon 5:63
 63 Behold, I am he that made an abridgment; therefore, I
am commanded that I should write it again. But I have
murdered it, and I have written it in the book which was
written by the Lord himself.

Mormon 5:64
 64 And it shall be kept and preserved by the remnant of
the house of Israel; therefore I write it not.

Mormon 5:65
 65 But behold, I make it known unto my people that I know
none of them. But behold, I have not written in this book.

Mormon 5:57
 57 But I have written many things which are written in my
memoirs, which shall be hereafter written, for some
many days yet cometh, and these shall be written according to
my words.

Mormon 5:58
 58 And when these shall be written, the heavens shall
pale; and utter darkness shall shake, and the earth shall
be rent asunder, and the inhabitants shall flee; for the
judgment-seat of the Lord hath judged me, and he
hath given me authority over the land.

Mormon 5:59
 59 For the Lord said unto me: If I had not commanded my
people, they would have been lost from the face of the earth. But
I have commanded my people, they have been lost. For out of the
promise land have I created them; therefore, I know them.

Mormon 5:60
 60 Behold, I know of the covenant which has been made between
the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which is a
brethrenship; therefore, it shall be a blessing upon them.

Mormon 5:61
 61 Nevertheless, the Lord hath said that I know them not; nevertheless,
he hath commanded me that I should write this record, and that I
should seal it up.

Mormon 5:62
 62 But I have not written it, neither have I read it; but it
shall be kept and preserved by the remnant of the house of
Israel, that they shall not perish, that the land of their
return may be as a forest, prepared by the Lord and his
children, for their transgression and their iniquity.

Mormon 5:63
 63 Behold, I am he that made an abridgment; therefore, I
am commanded that I should write it again. But I have
murdered it, and I have written it in the book which was
written by the Lord himself.

Mormon 5:64
 64 And it shall be kept and preserved by the remnant of
the house of Israel; therefore I write it not.

Mormon 5:65
 65 But behold, I make it known unto my people that I know
none of them. But behold, if they should find out my secret
plans they would destroy me.

Mormon 5:66
 66 Behold, I am he that made an abridgment; therefore,
I write it in my own hand.

Mormon 5:67
 67 And it shall be kept and preserved by the remnant of
the house of Israel; therefore I write it not.

Mormon 5:68
 68 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel, therefore I know
none of them. But behold, to all nations, kindreds, tongues and
people shall they say: The people of this house have
been led away, and they have become a stiffnecked people;
they have descended into wickedness, and they have become
weak like unto their fathers; they have taken upon them the
name. Therefore, they have become like unto their fathers; therefore
they are like unto the people of other nations.

Mormon 5:69
 69 And behold, the Lord hath said: I will establish my people,
and I will establish their king over them.

Mormon 5:70
 70 And behold, I, Moroni, write all the records which are
engraven upon the plates of brass; and whither I am sent, I
know not.

Mormon 5:71
 71 Behold, I am sent according to the voice of the Lord,
that I may know these things which are engraven upon the
plates of brass.

Mormon 5:72
 72 Behold, I know the scriptures, and all things pertaining
unto man, from the beginning of the world.

Mormon 5:73
 73 Behold, I know the pains of man, and all flesh; and I know
that it is better that men should be alone than that they
should suffer alone.

Mormon 5:74
 74 Therefore, I pray the Lord that he will remember the
words which he spake concerning man--that he will be merciful unto
some, to deliver them out of the hands of labor, that they may
have a place at the right hand of the Lord.

Mormon 5:75
 75 And now, all men, all men being under the power of the
enemy of my people, the Lamanites--I say they, because I
say unto you that all men; not he that is not of the house
of Israel, or who is not of the house of Israellans they would destroy me.

Mormon 5:66
 66 Behold, I am he that made an abridgment; therefore,
I write it in my own hand.

Mormon 5:67
 67 And it shall be kept and preserved by the remnant of
the house of Israel; therefore I write it not.

Mormon 5:68
 68 Behold, I am he of the house of Israel, therefore I know
none of them. But behold, to all nations, kindreds, tongues and
people shall they say: The people of this house have
been led away, and they have become a stiffnecked people;
they have descended into wickedness, and they have become
weak like unto their fathers; they have taken upon them the
name. Therefore, they have become like unto their fathers; therefore
they are like unto the people of other nations.

Mormon 5:69
 69 And behold, the Lord hath said: I will establish my people,
and I will establish their king over them.

Mormon 5:70
 70 And behold, I, Moroni, write all the records which are
engraven upon the plates of brass; and whither I am sent, I
know not.

Mormon 5:71
 71 Behold, I am sent according to the voice of the Lord,
that I may know these things which are engraven upon the
plates of brass.

Mormon 5:72
 72 Behold, I know the scriptures, and all things pertaining
unto man, from the beginning of the world.

Mormon 5:73
 73 Behold, I know the pains of man, and all flesh; and I know
that it is better that men should be alone than that they
should suffer alone.

Mormon 5:74
 74 Therefore, I pray the Lord that he will remember the
words which he spake concerning man--that he will be merciful unto
some, to deliver them out of the hands of labor, that they may
have a place at the right hand of the Lord.

Mormon 5:75
 75 And now, all men, all men being under the power of the
enemy of my people, the Lamanites--I say they, because I
say unto you that all men; not he that is not of the house
of Israel, or who is not of the house of Israel, but is of the
Lamanites--

Mormon 5:76
 76 Know ye that ye are not alone; neither doth any other nation
dwell so near to the earth, that it need any man to
bring it about unto them, that they may be nourished according to
that which is sacred.

Mormon 5:77
 77 Behold, ye are not of this the people; neither doth any
man that is not of this the people, but is of the house of
Israel, but is of the city of Jerusalem, that is, of the city
of David, and a remnant of the house of Jacob.

Mormon 5:78
 78 Know ye that ye are not alone; neither doth any man
dwell so near to the earth, that it need any man to
bring about unto them, that they may be nourished according to that
which is sacred.

Mormon 5:79
 79 Nevertheless, I pray the Lord that he will keep his commandments,
that he will prepare a place for the fulfilling of his word which he
has spoken. For behold, Jerusalem is destroyed; the city hath
begun to be a ruinous city; and the inhabitants thereof have
came down to destroy it.

Mormon 5:80
 80 Therefore, the Lord delivereth his people out of the hands of
Babylon, and bringeth about his covenants, and he doeth
according to his word in the earth; for he covenants with the
earth and with all the inhabitants thereof, that the earth should be
filled, and the inhabitants thereof be scattered upon the face of the whole
earth.

Mormon 5:81
 81 And it came to pass that it did commence to been
mentioned among all the people of the Lamanites, save they were
somewhat desirous to depart into the wilderness.

Mormon 5:82
 82 Nevertheless, they did not depart into the wilderness, and
were not desirous to return.

Mormon 5:83
 83 Therefore, the Lord commanded Moroni to take the remainder of
the prisoners, and also the gold, and the silver, and the
precious things which were possessed by the robbers;
yea, into the land of Middoni.

Mormon 5:84
se of Israel, but is of the
Lamanites--

Mormon 5:76
 76 Know ye that ye are not alone; neither doth any other nation
dwell so near to the earth, that it need any man to
bring it about unto them, that they may be nourished according to
that which is sacred.

Mormon 5:77
 77 Behold, ye are not of this the people; neither doth any
man that is not of this the people, but is of the house of
Israel, but is of the city of Jerusalem, that is, of the city
of David, and a remnant of the house of Jacob.

Mormon 5:78
 78 Know ye that ye are not alone; neither doth any man
dwell so near to the earth, that it need any man to
bring about unto them, that they may be nourished according to that
which is sacred.

Mormon 5:79
 79 Nevertheless, I pray the Lord that he will keep his commandments,
that he will prepare a place for the fulfilling of his word which he
has spoken. For behold, Jerusalem is destroyed; the city hath
begun to be a ruinous city; and the inhabitants thereof have
came down to destroy it.

Mormon 5:80
 80 Therefore, the Lord delivereth his people out of the hands of
Babylon, and bringeth about his covenants, and he doeth
according to his word in the earth; for he covenants with the
earth and with all the inhabitants thereof, that the earth should be
filled, and the inhabitants thereof be scattered upon the face of the whole
earth.

Mormon 5:81
 81 And it came to pass that it did commence to been
mentioned among all the people of the Lamanites, save they were
somewhat desirous to depart into the wilderness.

Mormon 5:82
 82 Nevertheless, they did not depart into the wilderness, and
were not desirous to return.

Mormon 5:83
 83 Therefore, the Lord commanded Moroni to take the remainder of
the prisoners, and also the gold, and the silver, and the
precious things which were possessed by the robbers;
yea, into the land of Middoni.

Mormon 5:84
 84 And he did take the remainder of the captives, and the
gold, and the silver, and the precious things, into the land of
Middoni.

Mormon 5:85
 85 And he caused the records to be kept and kept
according to the commandments of the Lord.

Mormon 5:86
 86 And it came to pass that he caused a part to be kept
in the wilderness; and this he did because of the
treachery of the people, because they had altered many
things which had been commanded them.

Mormon 5:87
 87 And it came to pass that he did cause the people to be
brought before him; and he did read unto them the records
which he had made, and to the people who were in the land of
Middoni; and he did cause them to be judged according to their
crime.

Mormon 5:88
 88 And he caused the people to be put to death; but they
choired and sang, saying:

Mormon 5:89
 89 The righteous shall live and he shall live to see the
day of judgment; all they who are compelled to do wickedly
shall die; for they shall see blood; they shall be as one
sorroweth.

Mormon 5:90
 90 And thus endeth the words of the Lord unto me, Moroni. And I
seek to know the cause of your perplexity; for, behold, I
know that ye are desirous to know the cause of your
sternness; and I am desirous also that ye should know the
cause why ye are troubled in spirit.

Mormon 5:91
 91 I know that ye are desirous that ye should know; and I
know that ye are desirous that ye should know; for ye knoweth
that ye are not alone.

Mormon 5:92
 92 And the Lord knows that ye are desirous that ye should
know; therefore I will give unto you a sign, and tell you
that there shall be among them those who are unwilling to
believe in the Son of righteousness.

Mormon 5:93
 93 Therefore, Moroni, I will give unto you a sign, that
such shall be among them; and it shall be because of
their unbelief.

Mormon 5:94
 94 Behold, the Lord hath said that 5:84
 84 And he did take the remainder of the captives, and the
gold, and the silver, and the precious things, into the land of
Middoni.

Mormon 5:85
 85 And he caused the records to be kept and kept
according to the commandments of the Lord.

Mormon 5:86
 86 And it came to pass that he caused a part to be kept
in the wilderness; and this he did because of the
treachery of the people, because they had altered many
things which had been commanded them.

Mormon 5:87
 87 And it came to pass that he did cause the people to be
brought before him; and he did read unto them the records
which he had made, and to the people who were in the land of
Middoni; and he did cause them to be judged according to their
crime.

Mormon 5:88
 88 And he caused the people to be put to death; but they
choired and sang, saying:

Mormon 5:89
 89 The righteous shall live and he shall live to see the
day of judgment; all they who are compelled to do wickedly
shall die; for they shall see blood; they shall be as one
sorroweth.

Mormon 5:90
 90 And thus endeth the words of the Lord unto me, Moroni. And I
seek to know the cause of your perplexity; for, behold, I
know that ye are desirous to know the cause of your
sternness; and I am desirous also that ye should know the
cause why ye are troubled in spirit.

Mormon 5:91
 91 I know that ye are desirous that ye should know; and I
know that ye are desirous that ye should know; for ye knoweth
that ye are not alone.

Mormon 5:92
 92 And the Lord knows that ye are desirous that ye should
know; therefore I will give unto you a sign, and tell you
that there shall be among them those who are unwilling to
believe in the Son of righteousness.

Mormon 5:93
 93 Therefore, Moroni, I will give unto you a sign, that
such shall be among them; and it shall be because of
their unbelief.

Mormon 5:94
 94 Behold, the Lord hath said that he would have mercy
on none but he should suffer; therefore, whatsoever
things should happen unto one of these shall be as a type
of things to come.

Mormon 5:95
 95 Therefore, the Lord hath said unto me, Moroni: Behold, this
shall be a sign sent unto you, that such shall be among
them; and this is because they believe in me; therefore, when they
really see me they shall rejoice.

Mormon 5:96
 96 And it shall come to pass that they shall be glad; yea, they
shall be glad because of the things which they know not.

Mormon 5:97
 97 And they shall also rejoice; for they believe in me, and
I know that they believe in me because of the things which
I have done in obtaining their faith.

Mormon 5:98
 98 But behold, this is not all; the Lord hath also said that: Inasmuch as
one of you shall doubt, him will I grant repentance to none save he
shall suffer myself to be doubtful; for thus saith the Lord:

Mormon 5:99
 99 If ye shall doubt, doubt not.

Mormon 5:100
 100 Behold, I know your thoughts; ye have had great desires in
me, to know the cause of your perplexity. Behold, I know your
thoughts; for ye have asked me concerning the prophecies of which
my father hath spoken.

Mormon 5:101
 101 I know your thoughts; and ye shall go forth and say; Behold, I know
your thoughts.

Mormon 5:102
 102 And I have tried my utmost to understand your thoughts; and
behold, ye say that ye have not known the prophecies of my father.
Behold, ye say that ye have known them; and ye say that ye have
perceived them in your heart.

Mormon 5:103
 103 And now, I say unto you, that if ye had known these things
your hearts would have been moved in other points. But behold, ye
have not hearkened unto me, or even if ye had, my words will
have been sufficient to have effect.

Mormon 5:104
 104 Now, I say unto you, that if ye have not read the
 hath said that he would have mercy
on none but he should suffer; therefore, whatsoever
things should happen unto one of these shall be as a type
of things to come.

Mormon 5:95
 95 Therefore, the Lord hath said unto me, Moroni: Behold, this
shall be a sign sent unto you, that such shall be among
them; and this is because they believe in me; therefore, when they
really see me they shall rejoice.

Mormon 5:96
 96 And it shall come to pass that they shall be glad; yea, they
shall be glad because of the things which they know not.

Mormon 5:97
 97 And they shall also rejoice; for they believe in me, and
I know that they believe in me because of the things which
I have done in obtaining their faith.

Mormon 5:98
 98 But behold, this is not all; the Lord hath also said that: Inasmuch as
one of you shall doubt, him will I grant repentance to none save he
shall suffer myself to be doubtful; for thus saith the Lord:

Mormon 5:99
 99 If ye shall doubt, doubt not.

Mormon 5:100
 100 Behold, I know your thoughts; ye have had great desires in
me, to know the cause of your perplexity. Behold, I know your
thoughts; for ye have asked me concerning the prophecies of which
my father hath spoken.

Mormon 5:101
 101 I know your thoughts; and ye shall go forth and say; Behold, I know
your thoughts.

Mormon 5:102
 102 And I have tried my utmost to understand your thoughts; and
behold, ye say that ye have not known the prophecies of my father.
Behold, ye say that ye have known them; and ye say that ye have
perceived them in your heart.

Mormon 5:103
 103 And now, I say unto you, that if ye had known these things
your hearts would have been moved in other points. But behold, ye
have not hearkened unto me, or even if ye had, my words will
have been sufficient to have effect.

Mormon 5:104
 104 Now, I say unto you, that if ye have not read the
word of God, and have not perceived that these things are
praised of God, if ye shall murmur against the Lord, ye shall be
cut off from the presence of the Lord.

Mormon 5:105
 105 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing we have thus
failed in our estimation, let us be firm, and come not again
into that which is sinful. Do not be troubled in the
praising your voices against heaven, or against the Eternal
Father, or against the Holy Ghost; but humble yourselves
before him, even as the poor in heart will humble himself
before the Father.

Mormon 5:106
 106 Now, my beloved brethren, I know that your hearts are
swollen with pride, and that your loins are too wide
to be carried on a journey in the wilderness without
having need of a guide; and behold, your wheels of
wheels are many, and your horses cast in the dust, and ye
are driven about by others, according to that which is
fallen upon you.

Mormon 5:107
 107 And now, behold, I say unto you, my beloved brethren, as I
am journeying to preach this unto you, after the manner of
their senseless
wickedness, having been led away by the voice of the
Lord, behold, I am brought away, even out of the land of my
nativity, after having laboriously prepared according to the
words of the righteous among my people; yea, behold, I am laden
with sorrow; and I feel myself to be a transgressor from
the presence of the Lord.

Mormon 5:108
 108 Behold, I am left, left to either mourn in the
wilderness, or to weep in the depths of the pit, for the
loss of the flesh and blood of my brethren.

Mormon 5:109
 109 And now, my beloved brethren, all these things have I
testified--I testified unto you that the beast and the
serpent did feed in the wilderness; and they were desirous to
be fattened; and they were also desirous to be sinew
like unto us, that they might have place in the body;
but behold, we know that they have not.

Mormon 5:110
 110 And it came to pass that we did make provision for
them; yea, we did work in the wilderness God, if ye shall murmur against the Lord, ye shall be
cut off from the presence of the Lord.

Mormon 5:105
 105 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing we have thus
failed in our estimation, let us be firm, and come not again
into that which is sinful. Do not be troubled in the
praising your voices against heaven, or against the Eternal
Father, or against the Holy Ghost; but humble yourselves
before him, even as the poor in heart will humble himself
before the Father.

Mormon 5:106
 106 Now, my beloved brethren, I know that your hearts are
swollen with pride, and that your loins are too wide
to be carried on a journey in the wilderness without
having need of a guide; and behold, your wheels of
wheels are many, and your horses cast in the dust, and ye
are driven about by others, according to that which is
fallen upon you.

Mormon 5:107
 107 And now, behold, I say unto you, my beloved brethren, as I
am journeying to preach this unto you, after the manner of
their senseless
wickedness, having been led away by the voice of the
Lord, behold, I am brought away, even out of the land of my
nativity, after having laboriously prepared according to the
words of the righteous among my people; yea, behold, I am laden
with sorrow; and I feel myself to be a transgressor from
the presence of the Lord.

Mormon 5:108
 108 Behold, I am left, left to either mourn in the
wilderness, or to weep in the depths of the pit, for the
loss of the flesh and blood of my brethren.

Mormon 5:109
 109 And now, my beloved brethren, all these things have I
testified--I testified unto you that the beast and the
serpent did feed in the wilderness; and they were desirous to
be fattened; and they were also desirous to be sinew
like unto us, that they might have place in the body;
but behold, we know that they have not.

Mormon 5:110
 110 And it came to pass that we did make provision for
them; yea, we did work in the wilderness for them.

Mormon 5:111
 111 Wherefore, they did not return, neither did we. I
know that we should return again, for they had diggged
out of the earth, having led away the heart of our people.

Mormon 5:112
 112 And it came to pass that our women and our children
were exceedingly sorrowful because of them; and we saw our
children grow up in the land of Egypt.

Mormon 5:113
 113 Yea, and we saw their utter destruction; for the
Lord had said unto our father: If thou shalt eat the fruit of
the tree thou shalt surely die; and also, if thou shalt
peel the branches of the tree thou shalt surely be cut off from
the tree.

Mormon 5:114
 114 And now, as we were, and were under the glory of the
Lord our God, even so we are now, and shall be forever; and
also, if we shall eat the fruit of the tree we shall be glad.

Mormon 5:115
 115 And we have been in the wilderness a long time; and the
Lord hath commanded us that we should not find any land.

Mormon 5:116
 116 And it came to pass that we did look all the face of the
land, and could find none; and the land had become covered
with ruins; and the people had become extinct.

Mormon 5:117
 117 And the land had become a wilderness, and the only inhabitant
thereof was a few animals of the forest.

Mormon 5:118
 118 And it came to pass that the Lord did bring forth his
words unto them, and said unto them: Eat the fruit thereof,
and be happy.

Mormon 5:119
 119 And it came to pass that when they had heard these
words they did eat, and they were filled; and they were also
bronze.

Mormon 5:120
 120 And the Lord was with them, and they were blessed.

Mormon 5:121
 121 And it came to pass that we took our tents, and we
planted the earth with the fruit of the tree, which was
desirable above all other fruit; and we did gather together all
the tribes of the people, both in the land of our
inhabitants and in the land of our inheritance; and we diderness for them.

Mormon 5:111
 111 Wherefore, they did not return, neither did we. I
know that we should return again, for they had diggged
out of the earth, having led away the heart of our people.

Mormon 5:112
 112 And it came to pass that our women and our children
were exceedingly sorrowful because of them; and we saw our
children grow up in the land of Egypt.

Mormon 5:113
 113 Yea, and we saw their utter destruction; for the
Lord had said unto our father: If thou shalt eat the fruit of
the tree thou shalt surely die; and also, if thou shalt
peel the branches of the tree thou shalt surely be cut off from
the tree.

Mormon 5:114
 114 And now, as we were, and were under the glory of the
Lord our God, even so we are now, and shall be forever; and
also, if we shall eat the fruit of the tree we shall be glad.

Mormon 5:115
 115 And we have been in the wilderness a long time; and the
Lord hath commanded us that we should not find any land.

Mormon 5:116
 116 And it came to pass that we did look all the face of the
land, and could find none; and the land had become covered
with ruins; and the people had become extinct.

Mormon 5:117
 117 And the land had become a wilderness, and the only inhabitant
thereof was a few animals of the forest.

Mormon 5:118
 118 And it came to pass that the Lord did bring forth his
words unto them, and said unto them: Eat the fruit thereof,
and be happy.

Mormon 5:119
 119 And it came to pass that when they had heard these
words they did eat, and they were filled; and they were also
bronze.

Mormon 5:120
 120 And the Lord was with them, and they were blessed.

Mormon 5:121
 121 And it came to pass that we took our tents, and we
planted the earth with the fruit of the tree, which was
desirable above all other fruit; and we did gather together all
the tribes of the people, both in the land of our
inhabitants and in the land of our inheritance; and we did
multiply them that they had not all perished by famine.

Mormon 5:122
 122 And we did plant seeds in the valley of the valley.

Mormon 5:123
 123 And we did gather together all the people that had
brought forth fruit into the valley. And thus we did in a very
little time establish peace in the land; and our people did not
become extinct.

Mormon 5:124
 124 And the Lord did bless them, and we began in the days of
the first king to build up again our land; our land being
desolate, and all around us the ruin of our people,
yea, even all around us.

Mormon 5:125
 125 And it came to pass that we began again to grow wheat in
the valley.

Mormon 5:126
 126 And our people began to multiply and spread; and we still
had to contend with the people of our inheritance, who
were the Nephites, yea, who were the seed of our father.

Mormon 5:127
 127 And it came to pass that while our people were in the
desolate state, the Spirit of the Lord did come down out of
the Lord unto us; and we did rejoice in the Lord, for our
father Abraham had not transfigured cherubim into a flaming fire
like unto them, but had commanded them to be hid up unto the Lord
in the earth.

Mormon 5:128
 128 Yea, the Lord had commanded us that we should build up a work
of righteousness, that we should make fire for their adorning, and
for their anointing; and also that we should make a fire for their
consecration.

Mormon 5:129
 129 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Behold, my people,
I will show unto thee, that thy righteousness shall be
great, and thy law shall be righteousness forever.

Mormon 5:130
 130 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did judge my people,
according to the commandment of the Lord.

Mormon 5:131
 131 And it came to pass that I did build up the work of
righteousness in the land.

Mormon 5:132
 132 And it came to pass that thed of our inheritance; and we did
multiply them that they had not all perished by famine.

Mormon 5:122
 122 And we did plant seeds in the valley of the valley.

Mormon 5:123
 123 And we did gather together all the people that had
brought forth fruit into the valley. And thus we did in a very
little time establish peace in the land; and our people did not
become extinct.

Mormon 5:124
 124 And the Lord did bless them, and we began in the days of
the first king to build up again our land; our land being
desolate, and all around us the ruin of our people,
yea, even all around us.

Mormon 5:125
 125 And it came to pass that we began again to grow wheat in
the valley.

Mormon 5:126
 126 And our people began to multiply and spread; and we still
had to contend with the people of our inheritance, who
were the Nephites, yea, who were the seed of our father.

Mormon 5:127
 127 And it came to pass that while our people were in the
desolate state, the Spirit of the Lord did come down out of
the Lord unto us; and we did rejoice in the Lord, for our
father Abraham had not transfigured cherubim into a flaming fire
like unto them, but had commanded them to be hid up unto the Lord
in the earth.

Mormon 5:128
 128 Yea, the Lord had commanded us that we should build up a work
of righteousness, that we should make fire for their adorning, and
for their anointing; and also that we should make a fire for their
consecration.

Mormon 5:129
 129 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Behold, my people,
I will show unto thee, that thy righteousness shall be
great, and thy law shall be righteousness forever.

Mormon 5:130
 130 And it came to pass that I, Moroni, did judge my people,
according to the commandment of the Lord.

Mormon 5:131
 131 And it came to pass that I did build up the work of
righteousness in the land.

Mormon 5:132
 132 And it came to pass that the land did prosper,
and wax great. And also in the days of Nephi there
was new stone cut out, exceedingly precious stones; and they
were great for building buildings of wood, and of copper, and for
iron, and for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of
precious things.

Mormon 5:133
 133 And it came to pass that the people did delight in them,
and did make of them finely wrought work of wood and of copper,
and of iron, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of
silver.

Mormon 5:134
 134 And it came to pass that I did also build
temples of stone, even in the valley of the valley of
Ishmael.

Mormon 5:135
 135 Nevertheless, I was commanded of the Lord that I should not
make certain of the precious stones which I had made.

Mormon 5:136
 136 And it came to pass that I did not, for I knew that;
therefore, I did not tell them; therefore they did ordain
men to stone-cut out of the rock, and to smite upon the
stones which they found there.

Mormon 5:137
 137 And they also found other stones. Yea, there were many
stones; wherefore, they were smitten upon; and they did
find other stones.

Mormon 5:138
 138 And it came to pass that the people were called
Nephites; yea, they were called Nephites, because of the
greatness of their skin.

Mormon 5:139
 139 And they were called by the people of Adam, to whom
they were accountable for the fall of man.

Mormon 5:140
 140 And they were also called Lamanites, meaning brethren.

Mormon 5:141
 141 And now, these are they whose fall was a transfiguration
of man; they were the sons of a woman, and they were
wounded.

Mormon 5:142
 142 Wherefore, it had come to pass in the days of Noah,
after the flood, that all mankind were in one body; yea,
therefore, there was one man, and he was called Limhi.

Mormon 5:143
 143 And he went forth among the people, preaching
thed it came to pass that the land did prosper,
and wax great. And also in the days of Nephi there
was new stone cut out, exceedingly precious stones; and they
were great for building buildings of wood, and of copper, and for
iron, and for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of
precious things.

Mormon 5:133
 133 And it came to pass that the people did delight in them,
and did make of them finely wrought work of wood and of copper,
and of iron, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of
silver.

Mormon 5:134
 134 And it came to pass that I did also build
temples of stone, even in the valley of the valley of
Ishmael.

Mormon 5:135
 135 Nevertheless, I was commanded of the Lord that I should not
make certain of the precious stones which I had made.

Mormon 5:136
 136 And it came to pass that I did not, for I knew that;
therefore, I did not tell them; therefore they did ordain
men to stone-cut out of the rock, and to smite upon the
stones which they found there.

Mormon 5:137
 137 And they also found other stones. Yea, there were many
stones; wherefore, they were smitten upon; and they did
find other stones.

Mormon 5:138
 138 And it came to pass that the people were called
Nephites; yea, they were called Nephites, because of the
greatness of their skin.

Mormon 5:139
 139 And they were called by the people of Adam, to whom
they were accountable for the fall of man.

Mormon 5:140
 140 And they were also called Lamanites, meaning brethren.

Mormon 5:141
 141 And now, these are they whose fall was a transfiguration
of man; they were the sons of a woman, and they were
wounded.

Mormon 5:142
 142 Wherefore, it had come to pass in the days of Noah,
after the flood, that all mankind were in one body; yea,
therefore, there was one man, and he was called Limhi.

Mormon 5:143
 143 And he went forth among the people, preaching
the word of God, and laboring with them to teach the
words of God unto them; wherefore, he became the leader of
the people; and as many as believed in him were blessed.

Mormon 5:144
 144 And he labored with the people whithersoever he
was directed, every man his own way, until he had so
far accomplished the thing which he had begun.

Mormon 5:145
 145 And his name was Abinadi.

Mormon 5:146
 146 And he began to prophesy unto the people concerning
the coming of the Messiah, that he should save his people if they
would repent and believe in him.

Mormon 5:147
 147 And he did say unto them: Thus saith the Lord, if my people
will believe in me, and harden not their hearts, and harden
their hearts against my words, then is the day that they shall
be lifted up at the last day; yea, they shall be lifted up at the last
day according to their words.

Mormon 5:148
 148 And it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these
words unto them, they did believe in him, and harden their
hearts against him, even as he had spoken unto them, thus saith the Lord:

Mormon 5:149
 149 And it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing shall be done by
me, it shall be done by him; and it shall come to pass that he can do
according to his words.

Mormon 5:150
 150 And it shall come to pass that after this manner shall all
things be fulfilled which shall be spoken by me, and by the
messenger which shall come from the Father.

Mormon 5:151
 151 And behold, this is the words which shall be spoken:

Mormon 5:152
 152 And the Father, because of me, shall bring forth upon the mountains of
the earth; and they shall be built up unto a great hill, even
up upon the lands of their inheritance.

Mormon 5:153
 153 And the sons of Nephi shall also go forth upon the coasts
of the sea; and they shall find gold, and silver, and
precious things.

Mormon 5:154
 154 And after they have found and diggednd laboring with them to teach the
words of God unto them; wherefore, he became the leader of
the people; and as many as believed in him were blessed.

Mormon 5:144
 144 And he labored with the people whithersoever he
was directed, every man his own way, until he had so
far accomplished the thing which he had begun.

Mormon 5:145
 145 And his name was Abinadi.

Mormon 5:146
 146 And he began to prophesy unto the people concerning
the coming of the Messiah, that he should save his people if they
would repent and believe in him.

Mormon 5:147
 147 And he did say unto them: Thus saith the Lord, if my people
will believe in me, and harden not their hearts, and harden
their hearts against my words, then is the day that they shall
be lifted up at the last day; yea, they shall be lifted up at the last
day according to their words.

Mormon 5:148
 148 And it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these
words unto them, they did believe in him, and harden their
hearts against him, even as he had spoken unto them, thus saith the Lord:

Mormon 5:149
 149 And it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing shall be done by
me, it shall be done by him; and it shall come to pass that he can do
according to his words.

Mormon 5:150
 150 And it shall come to pass that after this manner shall all
things be fulfilled which shall be spoken by me, and by the
messenger which shall come from the Father.

Mormon 5:151
 151 And behold, this is the words which shall be spoken:

Mormon 5:152
 152 And the Father, because of me, shall bring forth upon the mountains of
the earth; and they shall be built up unto a great hill, even
up upon the lands of their inheritance.

Mormon 5:153
 153 And the sons of Nephi shall also go forth upon the coasts
of the sea; and they shall find gold, and silver, and
precious things.

Mormon 5:154
 154 And after they have found and digged all these things
they shall return again, and the reward is with them; and
they shall find no gold, and no silver, nor any
precious thing upon the face of the earth;

Mormon 5:155
 155 Therefore the Father causeeth a man to be born of water, and
baketh in the dust; therefore the Son, because of the
Father, shall redeem his people.

Mormon 5:156
 156 And after my words which have been spoken by me,
it shall come to pass that after this manner cometh the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 5:157
 157 And it shall come to pass that after all these were
spoken by me, the Father sent a mediator among them; and
the Lord said unto them:

Mormon 5:158
 158 The Father, I speak to you again, concerning the resurrection of
the dead.

Mormon 5:159
 159 Behold, I have made it known unto you in my spirit, my
Father, concerning the resurrection of the dead; and this
I speak because of the perplexity of your minds which are
disoriented because of the things which have been spoken by
me concerning the resurrection.

Mormon 5:160
 160 For behold, I have written these things unto your
permission, that ye might know concerning the resurrection of
the dead.

Mormon 5:161
 161 And it came to pass that after the record had been
written by my father, except ye should deny the resurrection of the
dead, ye would all perish; for the Father knoweth all things;
and because of this things which I have written, ye are
confident that the things which ye have written shall be
true.

Mormon 5:162
 162 And now, behold, the things which ye shall write are
of my words; therefore, they are of my words. Therefore it
shall come to pass that whatsoever things are of my word shall be
of mine.

Mormon 5:163
 163 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that after the
dead have been raised to meet the Son of the living God,
in the state of resurrection, that then he shall manifest himself
unto the children of men.

Mormon 5:164
 164 And now, behold, the things which ye shall write are of
my words; therefore, they are ofand
they shall find no gold, and no silver, nor any
precious thing upon the face of the earth;

Mormon 5:155
 155 Therefore the Father causeeth a man to be born of water, and
baketh in the dust; therefore the Son, because of the
Father, shall redeem his people.

Mormon 5:156
 156 And after my words which have been spoken by me,
it shall come to pass that after this manner cometh the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 5:157
 157 And it shall come to pass that after all these were
spoken by me, the Father sent a mediator among them; and
the Lord said unto them:

Mormon 5:158
 158 The Father, I speak to you again, concerning the resurrection of
the dead.

Mormon 5:159
 159 Behold, I have made it known unto you in my spirit, my
Father, concerning the resurrection of the dead; and this
I speak because of the perplexity of your minds which are
disoriented because of the things which have been spoken by
me concerning the resurrection.

Mormon 5:160
 160 For behold, I have written these things unto your
permission, that ye might know concerning the resurrection of
the dead.

Mormon 5:161
 161 And it came to pass that after the record had been
written by my father, except ye should deny the resurrection of the
dead, ye would all perish; for the Father knoweth all things;
and because of this things which I have written, ye are
confident that the things which ye have written shall be
true.

Mormon 5:162
 162 And now, behold, the things which ye shall write are
of my words; therefore, they are of my words. Therefore it
shall come to pass that whatsoever things are of my word shall be
of mine.

Mormon 5:163
 163 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that after the
dead have been raised to meet the Son of the living God,
in the state of resurrection, that then he shall manifest himself
unto the children of men.

Mormon 5:164
 164 And now, behold, the things which ye shall write are of
my words; therefore, they are of my words and shall be kept
and preserved by the Father, and handed down unto my seed,
according to the word of the Father unto them according to
their faith and profession.

Mormon 5:165
 165 And now it shall come to pass that the things which
shall be written by the Father shall be written by the
Son; and they shall be kept and preserved by the Father and
handed down unto my seed, according to the word of the Father,
auniting for the greatest of all purposes to hear and know the
words of the Father;

Mormon 5:166
 166 And then also, that he may be manifested of the Father to
the children of men, that they may be found witnesses unto him of the
Father and also of the Son.

Mormon 5:167
 167 And behold, I am he, yea, and also he shall be meek,
and lowly in heart; and also the Father and I are one;
wherefore, we shall stand before God at the last day. Amen.

Chapter 6

Mormon 6:1
 1 And now I, Mormon, proceed to give my record of the
preservation of the saints of the church of Christ from the
destruction, that they may have the privilege of receiving a
reminder of these things from the Father, unto the
restoration of the church unto the true religion to which they
are committed, that perhaps they may be found spotless before God,
unto the fulfilling of the covenants of the Father which he
hath made to the children of men, as he hath covenanted
to redeem them.

Mormon 6:2
 2 Wherefore, my soul delighteth in the word of God, for I
have a perfect mind, and I know the things of God; for I do
know the thoughts of the hearts of men. And because I have
a perfect mind I know of my Father and of him that sent me;
and I know that he remembereth his children always, even unto the
restoration of his people.

Mormon 6:3
 3 For I have a perfect knowledge of my father, even
infinite knowledge; he hath not come into my father until after
the resurrection of the dead; wherefore, he remembereth his
children not.

Mormon 6:4
 4 Wherefore, my father shall be kept
and preserved by the Father, and handed down unto my seed,
according to the word of the Father unto them according to
their faith and profession.

Mormon 5:165
 165 And now it shall come to pass that the things which
shall be written by the Father shall be written by the
Son; and they shall be kept and preserved by the Father and
handed down unto my seed, according to the word of the Father,
auniting for the greatest of all purposes to hear and know the
words of the Father;

Mormon 5:166
 166 And then also, that he may be manifested of the Father to
the children of men, that they may be found witnesses unto him of the
Father and also of the Son.

Mormon 5:167

infinite knowledge; he hath not come into my father until after
the resurrection of the dead; wherefore, he remembereth his

Mormon 6:4
 4 Wherefore, my father hath taken upon him the record which
his father hath brought forth, of the coming of my father
out of the dust.

Mormon 6:5
 5 Wherefore, I, Mormon, read it. Behold, I say unto you, that I
perceive that my father hath sealed up the
records of the children of Israel, for they were hid up
treasures from the Lord, and from the days of my father,
away up unto the resurrection of the dead.

Mormon 6:6
 6 Wherefore, the Lord said that: Because of the righteousness of
Israel this great and abominable church hath been founded among
them; wherefore, they shall be restored to the knowledge of the Lord
their God.

Mormon 6:7
 7 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, after my father hath been
remembered of me--I am he that hath kept the records of my
father; and they shall be brought forth unto the children of
men.

Mormon 6:8
 8 And now, my sons, I desire that ye should remember my
father, and know of the things which he hath made known unto
you; and he hath been made known unto you by the power of the
Holy Ghost.

Mormon 6:9
 9 Wherefore, ye shall keep my commandments, and hearken unto my
words; and ye shall observe the statutes, and judgments, and
precepts of the elders of my church; for these are they which I have
made known unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 6:10
 10 And those things which I have made known unto you shall be given
unto your children at the last day, even unto the destruction of
the flesh, if ye shall keep the statutes, and the judgments, and
precepts of the elders of my church.

Mormon 6:11
 11 And it shall come to pass in the last days, this my
father hath commanded me, that I should write; and if I have not
written, behold, I know that thou hast commanded me that I should
write.

Mormon 6:12
 12 For I know that thou hast hid up the records unto thy
father, that he hath kept them; and they have been made manifest
unto the children of men.

Mormon 6:n 6:4

father hath commanded me, that I should write; and if I have not
written, behold, I know that thou hast commanded me that I should
write.

Mormon 6:12

father, that he hath kept them; and they have been made manifest
unto the children of men.

Mormon 6:13

my father hath seen fit in his wisdom, that he should bring them forth
unto the children of men, that the blood of him that suffered
the death of him that was affixed should come upon the children
of men, even as upon the children of their dead relatives.

Mormon 6:14
 14 Wherefore, my father hath commanded me that I should write them;
wherefore, I have.

Mormon 6:15
 15 And it came to pass that I have. And I did write them in
the days of my father, that he did recover from his last
death; wherefore, Moroni caused that I should be brought before him
to be judged at the last day.

Chapter 7

Mormon 7:1
 1 And now it came to pass that the Lord saw fit in his wisdom
that he might show unto my father, Lehi, concerning the
records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, that
they should be delivered unto my father, who should translate them
unto his father, which would cause them to be kept and
handed down unto their children, that they may be kept and
handed down unto their children from time to time according to
their faith and repentance; which things are done by the power of
the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 7:2
 2 And now, my sons, I perceive that thou hast been led away by
the Spirit of the Lord, that I cannot write the things which thou
hast seen.

Mormon 7:3
 3 And I cannot write the things which thou hast heard; wherefore, I
do not write them, for I am constrained of the Lord that thou
shalt preserve them.

Mormon 7:4
 4 And now I know that this is the desire of the Lord; for he
delivered them unto my father, that he might show them forth
unto his people.

Mormon 7:5
 5 Therefore I do not write them, for I have kept them, and
translated them in my days; therefore I translate them
them again.

Mormon 7:6

handed down unto the children of men.

Mormon 7:7

them in my days; and also many more remain to be translated
in mine own wisdom.

Mormon 7:8
 8 Wherefore, the Lord said unto me, translate these
things which thou hast seen.

Mormon 7:9
 9 And I said unto him: If thou wilt translate these
things which thou hast seen, and keep them, that the Jews
may know the plainness of them, then cometh a great
revelation.

Mormon 7:10
 10 And he said: Are we to believe that the Lord showed
these things unto our fathers, and also unto our
brethren, who were of the house of Israel, and to the
other tribes which were a descendant of Joseph?

Mormon 7:11
 11 And the Lord said unto me: Yea, I believe that the Lord
may have shown these things unto our fathers, and also
concerning the other tribes which had been scattered abroad
upon the face of the earth--concerning all the children
of my people.

Mormon 7:12
 12 Wherefore, I said unto him: Yea, the Lord, the Lord
said unto me: Show these things unto thy people.

Mormon 7:13
 13 And it came to pass that I said unto him that: Yea,
I believe that the Lord hath said these things; and I
am desirous that the Lord should make known unto my people the
conversion which he hath shown unto us.

Mormon 7:14
 14 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Behold I say unto you,
that the Lord hath said these things because that he desired that
ye should know concerning the other tribes which had been scattered
away upon the face of the earth.

Mormon 7:15
 15 For behold, this was a choice band which he had formed,
which he said, may the Lord show unto thy people; and he
said unto me: Yea, this is a choice band; and he said unto
me: Prepare the records which are to be kept by the
collection of the remains of this people.

Mormon 7:16
 16 And it came to pass that I said unto him: Will ye do this
that I may know concerning theen of men.

Mormon 7:7

them in my days; and also many more remain to be translated
in mine own wisdom.

Mormon 7:8

things which thou hast seen.

Mormon 7:9

that I may know concerning the other tribes which have
been lost?

Mormon 7:17
 17 And he said unto me: Yea, I will go and do this thing; and
I will also declare these records to thy people who are a
reproach unto thee for the many wickednesses which thou hast
shown unto them.

Mormon 7:18
 18 But I will not go to the land of Jerusalem until I know of
thy faith.

Mormon 7:19
 19 And it came to pass that I said unto him: Behold I know that
thou shalt not go to the land of Jerusalem until thou hast
forsaken all thy gold and thy silver, even to the utter
destruction of thy people.

Mormon 7:20
 20 And I say unto you that if thou shalt not do this, and
also all thy precious things, behold, this night shall
come upon thee, a burning fire; yea, a fire which shall never
be quenched.

Mormon 7:21
 21 And I say unto you that thou shalt not eat nor drink nor
consume nor use any deadly thing, until the Lord commandeth
thou that thou shalt take possession of the land.

Mormon 7:22
 22 And I say also that the time cometh that the Lord God
shall bring forth his words unto thee, for thou shalt know that
the time cometh at that day that the fulness of his
words shall be made known unto thee, that he shall say:

Mormon 7:23
 23 My soul delighteth in the fatality of my people;

Mormon 7:24
 24 And also my soul delighteth in the disgrace of this people;
wherefore, thou shalt not slay thy people until they shall prove
themselves before me.

Mormon 7:25
 25 Thou shalt not slay, save it be in the defence of thy
life; and if it so be that thy life is taken, thou shalt
suffer them that kill thee also.

Mormon 7:26
 26 And in the defense of thy life, thou shalt not kill, but
if thy life is taken, vengeance thy upon them that
have slain thy life.

Mormon 7:27
 27 And it came to pass that I said unto him: If my
life were at stake, I would take ye do this
that I may know concerning the other tribes which have
been lost?

Mormon 7:17
 17 And he said unto me: Yea, I will go and do this thing; and
I will also declare these records to thy people who are a
reproach unto thee for the many wickednesses which thou hast
shown unto them.

Mormon 7:18
 18 But I will not go to the land of Jerusalem until I know of
thy faith.

Mormon 7:19
 19 And it came to pass that I said unto him: Behold I know that
thou shalt not go to the land of Jerusalem until thou hast
forsaken all thy gold and thy silver, even to the utter
destruction of thy people.

Mormon 7:20
 20 And I say unto you that if thou shalt not do this, and
also all thy precious things, behold, this night shall
come upon thee, a burning fire; yea, a fire which shall never
be quenched.

Mormon 7:21
 21 And I say unto you that thou shalt not eat nor drink nor
consume nor use any deadly thing, until the Lord commandeth
thou that thou shalt take possession of the land.

Mormon 7:22
 22 And I say also that the time cometh that the Lord God
shall bring forth his words unto thee, for thou shalt know that
the time cometh at that day that the fulness of his
words shall be made known unto thee, that he shall say:

Mormon 7:23
 23 My soul delighteth in the fatality of my people;

Mormon 7:24
 24 And also my soul delighteth in the disgrace of this people;
wherefore, thou shalt not slay thy people until they shall prove
themselves before me.

Mormon 7:25
 25 Thou shalt not slay, save it be in the defence of thy
life; and if it so be that thy life is taken, thou shalt
suffer them that kill thee also.

Mormon 7:26
 26 And in the defense of thy life, thou shalt not kill, but
if thy life is taken, vengeance thy upon them that
have slain thy life.

Mormon 7:27
 27 And it came to pass that I said unto him: If my
life were at stake, I would take my life as a witness against
thou that doeth this thing.

Mormon 7:28
 28 But behold, I say unto you, that if my life were at
stake, I would not suffer my death in the defence of my
people, that they should be destroyed if they should raise their
voices against thee.

Mormon 7:29
 29 I say unto you, that if my life were at stake, I would
immediately slay them that sought to destroy my life; for assured
is he that his life will be restored unto him at the last
day; and he that has himeth the life of him that has him.

Mormon 7:30
 30 And now, behold, I say unto you, that if my life were
at stake, I would suffer the loss of my people, even to the
judgment-seat of my people, to make this statement.

Mormon 7:31
 31 And I say unto you, that I have been restrained by the Spirit
of the Lord that I could not speak these things unto my people; for I
had consecrated those things unto others.

Mormon 7:32
 32 And my soul delighteth in the glory of my people, the
Lamanites; and it grieveth my soul that the Lamanites should
be destroyed.

Mormon 7:33
 33 I say unto you, that because they are destroyed they have
not the glory of the Lord, neither the counsel of his Spirit which
is in them, which counsel is to manifest the good
of me and my people.

Mormon 7:34
 34 But behold, my soul delighteth in the glory of my people,
the Nephites; and I would that my soul might be happy if it
were not so, that my people could shine forth upon the face of
this land, unto the of their salvation.

Mormon 7:35
 35 But behold, I say unto you, that after this manner they have
been destroyed; for they have been taught by the priests
of the true church, that they should be destroyed, as was
prepared for the purpose that they should perish by reason
of transgression; for they being so many were thrown together,
that as many as were not of the true church were
wounded; therefore they were lost, even as I havegainst
thou that doeth this thing.

Mormon 7:28
 28 But behold, I say unto you, that if my life were at
stake, I would not suffer my death in the defence of my
people, that they should be destroyed if they should raise their
voices against thee.

Mormon 7:29
 29 I say unto you, that if my life were at stake, I would
immediately slay them that sought to destroy my life; for assured
is he that his life will be restored unto him at the last
day; and he that has himeth the life of him that has him.

Mormon 7:30
 30 And now, behold, I say unto you, that if my life were
at stake, I would suffer the loss of my people, even to the
judgment-seat of my people, to make this statement.

Mormon 7:31
 31 And I say unto you, that I have been restrained by the Spirit
of the Lord that I could not speak these things unto my people; for I
had consecrated those things unto others.

Mormon 7:32
 32 And my soul delighteth in the glory of my people, the
Lamanites; and it grieveth my soul that the Lamanites should
be destroyed.

Mormon 7:33
 33 I say unto you, that because they are destroyed they have
not the glory of the Lord, neither the counsel of his Spirit which
is in them, which counsel is to manifest the good
of me and my people.

Mormon 7:34
 34 But behold, my soul delighteth in the glory of my people,
the Nephites; and I would that my soul might be happy if it
were not so, that my people could shine forth upon the face of
this land, unto the of their salvation.

Mormon 7:35
 35 But behold, I say unto you, that after this manner they have
been destroyed; for they have been taught by the priests
of the true church, that they should be destroyed, as was
prepared for the purpose that they should perish by reason
of transgression; for they being so many were thrown together,
that as many as were not of the true church were
wounded; therefore they were lost, even as I have been
wounded.

Mormon 7:36
 36 And it came to pass that those priests, by the word of
the Lord, did bring them forth from hell; and this is the
result of their transgression.

Mormon 7:37
 37 And it came to pass that after they had been brought forth,
and had been laid upon plates in the earth for the space of many
years, behold, I, Moroni, began to be old, having been
wounded by the sword; nevertheless, in the sickness of my mind I
resigned from day to day because of the vain things which I
had desired of the Lord.

Mormon 7:38
 38 And I did not seek the glory of the world, therefore I
did not enjoy my days; but I did labor exceedingly,
for I did put my whole soul into the laboring to bring forth
the records which had been hid up unto the Lord.

Mormon 7:39
 39 But behold, the Lord spake many more things unto me, which
saithings and doings I have not written; therefore I have
commenced this record, and it hath been kept and preserved,
by mine own hand.

Mormon 8
Chapter 8

Mormon 8:1
 1 Behold, I write the remainder of the words of my father,
Mormon. I write it not to finish my record--I know that it
must be kept for the record--but I write it because I have
so great sorrows for the record that I cannot write it.

Mormon 8:2
 2 For I know that the things of which my father has written
are grievous unto my soul; for behold, they have been translated
into many languages, and into all manner of hearts, among my
people.

Mormon 8:3
 3 Behold, they have been kept from the world and
tradition of the people, until the Lord commanded
him that I should write them.

Mormon 8:4
 4 And behold, I have written them, and they have been
traditionally kept and preserved until this day; and I
take them upon me to write them.

Mormon 8:5
 5 But behold, this is not all: I take them upon me
to write the accounts of my people who have been slain,
and also of those who are alive, because ofnded.

Mormon 7:36
 36 And it came to pass that those priests, by the word of
the Lord, did bring them forth from hell; and this is the
result of their transgression.

Mormon 7:37
 37 And it came to pass that after they had been brought forth,
and had been laid upon plates in the earth for the space of many
years, behold, I, Moroni, began to be old, having been
wounded by the sword; nevertheless, in the sickness of my mind I
resigned from day to day because of the vain things which I
had desired of the Lord.

Mormon 7:38
 38 And I did not seek the glory of the world, therefore I
did not enjoy my days; but I did labor exceedingly,
for I did put my whole soul into the laboring to bring forth

take them upon me to write them.

Mormon 8:5
 5 But behold, this is not all: I take them upon me
to write the accounts of my people who have been slain,
and also of those who are alive, because of the
traditions of the people which were kept back.

Mormon 8:6
 6 And it hath been kept and preserved until this day;
and I pray the Father in the name of Jesus, that he will
give them power to be unfolded unto my people, that they may
read and know of the mysteries of God that which is hid
up unto the Lord.

Mormon 8:7
 7 And I pray unto him that he will grant unto me that my
people may be restored unto ye, in the kingdom of our
heaven.

Mormon 8:8
 8 And now, my beloved brethren, I do not write the
accounts of those who are dead, save it be that they shall
advise me; for it grieveth me also to write the
unto you.

Mormon 8:9
 9 Behold, I write the account of my father, the
Father, of the changes which have been wrought among his
people; and I write it because I am desirous that others
should know concerning them.

Mormon 8:10
 10 And it came to pass that in the latter end of the thirtieth
year from the coming of my father, Lehi, he was called
Mormon, and departed from the land of Jerusalem, and took
upon him the name of Mormon, which said he was a descendant of
the Jews.

Mormon 8:11
 11 And he came to the land of Middoni; and his father had
wounded some of the people with a gladness; but the worse
off were the people, for they were confounded and
instructed against me, because they knew not that it had been
their fathers who had brought them up out of the land of
Jershon; yea, they knew not that it had been their fathers who
had brought them up out of the land of Jershon; yet, my father
had received a remission of their sins, and they were
confounded against me.

Mormon 8:12
 12 And they knew not, save they saw his sayings in
my spirit, saying: In thy name shalt thou stone me, and I
shall be thy seed; and thou shalt no more worship thy father
nor thy mother nor thy gods nor serve thy rulers nor obey
the voice of thy princes.

traditions of the people which were kept back.

Mormon 8:6
 6 And it hath been kept and preserved until this day;
and I pray the Father in the name of Jesus, that he will
give them power to be unfolded unto my people, that they may
read and know of the mysteries of God that which is hid
up unto the Lord.

Mormon 8:7
 7 And I pray unto him that he will grant unto me that my
people may be restored unto ye, in the kingdom of our
heaven.

Mormon 8:8
 8 And now, my beloved brethren, I do not write the
accounts of those who are dead, save it be that they shall
advise me; for it grieveth me also to write the
unto you.

Mormon 8:9
 9 Behold, I write the account of my father, the
Father, of the changes which have been wrought among his
people; and I write it because I am desirous that others
should know concerning them.

Mormon 8:10
 10 And it came to pass that in the latter end of the thirtieth
year from the coming of my father, Lehi, he was called
Mormon, and departed from the land of Jerusalem, and took
upon him the name of Mormon, which said he was a descendant of
the Jews.

Mormon 8:11
 11 And he came to the land of Middoni; and his father had

had received a remission of their sins, and they were
confounded against me.

Mormon 8:12
 12 And they knew not, save they saw his sayings in
my spirit, saying: In thy name shalt thou stone me, and I
shall be thy seed; and thou shalt no more worship thy father
nor thy mother nor thy gods nor serve thy rulers nor obey
the voice of thy princes.

Mormon 8:13
 13 For I, Mormon, am a dissenter from the house of
Israel; and I have come up into this land, to dissolve the
eternal bonds of the land.

Mormon 8:14
 14 Thou hast consecrated me to the office of this people to
preserve thy seed; and also, that this people may know that
the seed of thy father shall not be destroyed, that the seed
of thy father shall be preserved.

Mormon 8:15
 15 And thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord which I
have seen and done; and if my father should die in the land
of Middoni, thou shalt take upon me the responsibility of his
death; for thou shalt not slay nor destroy nor convert nor
nor shall any man teach nor administer any manner of
substance to thee, save thou shalt do this, that the seed of
my father shall not be destroyed.

Mormon 8:16
 16 And thus ended the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi; for they began to be astonished
at my writing; for they knew not that I had hitherto been
consistent in keeping the laws and the commandments of the Lord.

Mormon 8:17
 17 And they were desirous to know concerning the preservation of their
sons;

Mormon 8:18
 18 For behold, the Lord had shown unto me in a vision, that
I should preserve my father and my mother and my kin, that none of
these perish save they know of me; wherefore, I see that they
are preserved, even unto the resurrection of the dead.

Mormon 8:19
 19 And now it came to pass that I did write a few more
things unto the people, for I saw that the mind of the
people had become changed; yea, and I also saw that the
people began to know concerning the things of Nephi;

Mormon 8:20
 20 For I beheld that the voice of the people began
to be more exact; yea, and I also saw that the people began
to know concerning the captivity of our fathers; for I
beheld that their sorrows were as well as their joys.

Mormon 8:21
 21 And I also saw that the voice of the people began to be
much more subdued; for theer from the house of
Israel; and I have come up into this land, to dissolve the
eternal bonds of the land.

Mormon 8:14
 14 Thou hast consecrated me to the office of this people to
preserve thy seed; and also, that this people may know that
the seed of thy father shall not be destroyed, that the seed
of thy father shall be preserved.

Mormon 8:15
 15 And thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord which I
have seen and done; and if my father should die in the land
of Middoni, thou shalt take upon me the responsibility of his
death; for thou shalt not slay nor destroy nor convert nor
nor shall any man teach nor administer any manner of
substance to thee, save thou shalt do this, that the seed of
my father shall not be destroyed.

I should preserve my father and my mother and my kin, that none of
these perish save they know of me; wherefore, I see that they
are preserved, even unto the resurrection of the dead.

Mormon 8:19
 19 And now it came to pass that I did write a few more
things unto the people, for I saw that the mind of the
people had become changed; yea, and I also saw that the
people began to know concerning the things of Nephi;

Mormon 8:20
 20 For I beheld that the voice of the people began
to be more exact; yea, and I also saw that the people began
to know concerning the captivity of our fathers; for I
beheld that their sorrows were as well as their joys.

Mormon 8:21
 21 And I also saw that the voice of the people began to be
much more subdued; for the voice of the people began to
be much more restrained because of the wickedness of the
government; for they began to be lifted up in the pride of their
eyes; for they began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes
because they were desirous to possess the land of Middoni, which
was possessed by their brethren, the Lamanites.

Mormon 8:22
 22 Yea, I saw that the people began to be desirous to
possess all the land of Middoni, which had been possessed by
their brethren; yea, I saw even the Spirit of the Lord
begin to be somewhat mingled in the hearts of the people;
for they began to know that there was but a remnant scattered
throughout all the face of the land; for out of the land there would
be no Zion.

Mormon 8:23
 23 And I beheld that the spirit of the Lord began to be faint in
the land; and the Lord began to be angry with them, saying: Because
of thy wickedness in retaining the land, for the land is no more
desolate.

Mormon 8:24
 24 And he said: All the land, save it be this, is desolate.
Therefore, all the people who are scattered shall be gathered in,
to the house of Israel; and because thou hast retained thy land, thou
shalt be thy people; for thou shalt be thy people, and I am thy
Lord.

Mormon 8:25
 25 But, behold, the Lamanites are not so foolish as thou,
lest they should destroy this people; for they know not that
the Lord hath a mercy upon the children of Zion, but unto them that
are lost.

Mormon 8:26
 26 Wherefore, I will make my sword, and I will make my cleansing
oil; and I will make my righteousness, and I will make my
iraq; and in my righteousness will I find for them.

Mormon 8:27
 27 Therefore, O all ye who are scattered by your brethren, I
say unto you, go forth and proclaim the word of the Lord, until
ye shall be gathered together, and shall be filled with the joy
of the Lord, and shall feel no more affliction; yea, and I
say this, because of the mercies of the Lord, which he hath
inflicted upon the children of Zion.

say unto you, go forth and proclaim the word of the Lord, until
ye shall be gathered together, and shall be filled with the joy
of the Lord, and shall feel no more affliction; yea, and I
say this, because of the mercies of the Lord, which he hath
inflicted upon the children of Zion.

Mormon 8:28
 28 For behold, he hath made bare his loins in the eyes of the
nations; and in his righteousness he hath caused the waters to
melt; and in his righteousness hath he caused to be registered in
the number of the waters which did overflow in the
depths.

Mormon 8:29
 29 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, I will cause in my own
power that they shall be gathered together; yea, I say it unto you
that the Lord God will raise up another nation.

Mormon 8:30
 30 Yea, all ye who are scattered among the nations,
there are no kindreds nor creeds among them; neither doth
they any more differ in kind nor in substance from one
to another; but they do differ in this, that there is
another nation formed among them, not of the same stock,
made up of a pure blood, as well of the beginning as of
the end.

Mormon 8:31
 31 And thus saith the Lord, the Lord God will establish another nation
in the land; and it shall be called the people of Nephi; and they
shall be distinguished from all other nations; and this because of
their exceeding faith in the words which they have received
from the mouth of the prophets.

Mormon 8:32
 32 And now I say unto you that this is the nation; and this is
the land; and they who do believe in the words which have been
spoken by the prophets, to preach of wars and contentions, and
their trials and their troubles, and their hardships and their
afflictions--they are they who are called by this people to
declare war, yea, to fight for the freedom of their country.

Mormon 8:33
 33 And now I say unto you that this is the people of the nation,
which has come, that are determined to maintain their liberty and
their country.

Mormon 8:34
 34 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God will send among
them, men who will discover their secret plans and
diversaries, to destroy them by the sword; and this he will do
because of their exceeding faith, even to the destruction of the
United States.

Mormon 8:35
 35 Behold, I say unto28
 28 For behold, he hath made bare his loins in the eyes of the
nations; and in his righteousness he hath caused the waters to
melt; and in his righteousness hath he caused to be registered in
the number of the waters which did overflow in the
depths.

Mormon 8:29
 29 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, I will cause in my own
power that they shall be gathered together; yea, I say it unto you
that the Lord God will raise up another nation.

Mormon 8:33
 33 And now I say unto you that this is the people of the nation,
which has come, that are determined to maintain their liberty and
their country.

Mormon 8:34
 34 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God will send among
them, men who will discover their secret plans and
diversaries, to destroy them by the sword; and this he will do
because of their exceeding faith, even to the destruction of the
United States.

Mormon 8:35
 35 Behold, I say unto you that this is the plan of destruction which
the Lord God shall establish among them.

Mormon 8:36
 36 And now I say unto you that nothing save it be repentance of
their sins will save them from falling into the pit of hell.

Mormon 8:37
 37 And now I say unto you that this is the plan of destruction which
the Lord God shall establish among them; yea, it is the plan of the
Lord that hath declared the covenants of the Father unto the
people of Jacob.

Mormon 8:38
 38 And it shall come to pass that the Lord said unto him: Go forth
among the people, and say unto them--Repent ye, for thus saith the
Lord: I am he that promised you; and I will fulfil my covenant to
the fulfilling of my covenant which I have made unto the
people of the house of Israel.

Mormon 8:39
 39 And it shall come to pass that the Lord said unto him: Go forth
among the people, and say unto them--Repent ye, for thus saith the
Lord: Ye shall come forth and know of my righteous judgments; and
it shall come to pass that whoso repenteth me, it shall come to
pass that I will punish them not.

Mormon 8:40
 40 Therefore, after the Lord had spoken these words, he commanded
him that he should send among the people, among all the house
of Israel; and behold, this is the man whom he hath appointed to
rejoice in the true and living God. Yea, he is he that gathereth
the fruit of thy loins.

Mormon 8:41
 41 Or in other words, he that knoweth of my sitting and
rejoiceeth of my fruits, him I will rejoice in, to the
fulfilling of my covenant which I have made unto the house
of Israel.

Mormon 8:42
 42 And now, all these things concerning the judgments of the Lord
concerning these things--that the fruit of thy loins shall be
wrought upon the fruit, and by that same Power which is in the
Giantess, they shall be delivered--I mean the power which is in the
Giantess, which shall bring them forth unto the fruit.

Mormon 8:43
 43 And behold, my son, I know of the tree of which I have
spoken, whicht this is the plan of destruction which
the Lord God shall establish among them.

Mormon 8:36
 36 And now I say unto you that nothing save it be repentance of
their sins will save them from falling into the pit of hell.

Mormon 8:37
 37 And now I say unto you that this is the plan of destruction which
the Lord God shall establish among them; yea, it is the plan of the
Lord that hath declared the covenants of the Father unto the
people of Jacob.

Mormon 8:38
 38 And it shall come to pass that the Lord said unto him: Go forth
among the people, and say unto them--Repent ye, for thus saith the
Lord: I am he that promised you; and I will fulfil my covenant to
the fulfilling of my covenant which I have made unto the
people of the house of Israel.

Mormon 8:39
 39 And it shall come to pass that the Lord said unto him: Go forth
among the people, and say unto them--Repent ye, for thus saith the
Lord: Ye shall come forth and know of my righteous judgments; and
it shall come to pass that whoso repenteth me, it shall come to
pass that I will punish them not.

Mormon 8:40
 40 Therefore, after the Lord had spoken these words, he commanded
him that he should send among the people, among all the house
of Israel; and behold, this is the man whom he hath appointed to
rejoice in the true and living God. Yea, he is he that gathereth
the fruit of thy loins.

Mormon 8:41
 41 Or in other words, he that knoweth of my sitting and
rejoiceeth of my fruits, him I will rejoice in, to the
fulfilling of my covenant which I have made unto the house
of Israel.

Mormon 8:42
 42 And now, all these things concerning the judgments of the Lord
concerning these things--that the fruit of thy loins shall be
wrought upon the fruit, and by that same Power which is in the
Giantess, they shall be delivered--I mean the power which is in the
Giantess, which shall bring them forth unto the fruit.

Mormon 8:43
 43 And behold, my son, I know of the tree of which I have
spoken, which is the fruit of thy loins; and my other
things I know.

Mormon 8:44
 44 Behold, I have called thee, thy brother, thy son, thy
elder, thy younger; all these things are meant.

Mormon 8:45
 45 Behold, these things are not meant for all men;
therefore, I speak unto you as if I had said them for
you; and after these things have I called thee, thy
brother, thy son, thy younger.

Mormon 8:46
 46 And these things are not meant for all men to be saved;
therefore, my son, these things are not meant for all men to
be saved.

Mormon 8:47
 47 But my son, these things are meant for all men to know;
and if all men know them, and know of that which is good, and
also that which is evil, behold, this is light unto them; and
if all men know of this, and know of that which is good, behold,
this is darkness unto them, and their utter destruction.

Mormon 8:48
 48 Therefore, my son, I speak unto you as if I had said them
for you; and then I would have said them for you, for were
it so, ye would have known them.

Mormon 8:49
 49 But I have spoken plainly unto you; therefore, if ye know not
these things, ye are not worthy to hear my words.

Mormon 8:50
 50 For behold, I say unto you that there are many that are discomfited
according to the word of the Lord which I have sent, and many of
them are found not, because of unbelief.

Mormon 8:51
 51 And I said unto you, there are many who are lost; and if
they are not found, they are translated at once into other
hearts; and there are many who are lost at Jerusalem.

Mormon 8:52
 52 And I also said unto you, that there are many who are
carried away captive into distant lands; and if they die in
the land, the remainder are delivered up into the hands
of their enemies, and are delivered up into the hands of those
who are not converted.

Mit.

Mormon 8:43
 43 And behold, my son, I know of the tree of which I have
spoken, which is the fruit of thy loins; and my other
things I know.

Mormon 8:44
 44 Behold, I have called thee, thy brother, thy son, thy
elder, thy younger; all these things are meant.

Mormon 8:45
 45 Behold, these things are not meant for all men;
therefore, I speak unto you as if I had said them for
you; and after these things have I called thee, thy
brother, thy son, thy younger.

Mormon 8:46
 46 And these things are not meant for all men to be saved;
therefore, my son, these things are not meant for all men to
be saved.

Mormon 8:47
 47 But my son, these things are meant for all men to know;
and if all men know them, and know of that which is good, and
also that which is evil, behold, this is light unto them; and
if all men know of this, and know of that which is good, behold,
this is darkness unto them, and their utter destruction.

Mormon 8:48
 48 Therefore, my son, I speak unto you as if I had said them
for you; and then I would have said them for you, for were
it so, ye would have known them.

Mormon 8:49
 49 But I have spoken plainly unto you; therefore, if ye know not
these things, ye are not worthy to hear my words.

Mormon 8:50
 50 For behold, I say unto you that there are many that are discomfited
according to the word of the Lord which I have sent, and many of
them are found not, because of unbelief.

Mormon 8:51
 51 And I said unto you, there are many who are lost; and if
they are not found, they are translated at once into other
hearts; and there are many who are lost at Jerusalem.

Mormon 8:52
 52 And I also said unto you, that there are many who are
carried away captive into distant lands; and if they die in
the land, the remainder are delivered up into the hands
of their enemies, and are delivered up into the hands of those
who are not converted.

Mormon 8:53
 53 And if they are not found, they are translated, and
their names are taken, that they may be blotted out of
his book, that no part of the book may be written of them.

Mormon 8:54
 54 Wherefore, I would speak unto all the people, yea, all
the house of Israel, yea, all the house of the Lord,
concerning the things which I have spoken unto you, and
which shall come to pass after this manner.

Mormon 8:55
 55 And it came to pass that they all spake one unto another,
saying: What meaneth these things which we have said?
Behold, are they to come to pass according to the spirit of
prophecy? or in the spirit of prophecy? for behold, it is
known that such things as have been prophesied concerning us by
the prophets are fulfilled.

Mormon 8:56
 56 And now, my son, these things which we have said, yea,
concerning the things of which we have said we shall also
say concerning the things which shall come after.

Mormon 8:57
 57 And now, my son, I will tell you concerning the prophecies of
Jerusalem. Behold, I say unto you, that the days of the Lord
Jerusalem shall be fulfilled, and Jerusalem shall be destroyed; and the
tears of anguish shall come upon them who shall render unto the Lord
Famine.

Mormon 8:58
 58 For behold, the time cometh that they shall be in a state
of many afflictions; first, because they shall be lifted up at the
feet of men; secondly, because they shall be drunken with the
alms of the poor; thirdly, because they shall be satiated with the
words of the book.

Mormon 8:59
 59 And they shall be surrounded with a marvelous work of
mercies; yea, a marvelous work of justice; yea, a marvelous
work of righteousness unto them, that they shall be saved at the
hand of the Lord.

Mormon 8:60
 60 And after this manner of language shall they be written.
And the Lord shall write them, and seal them up; and they
shall be kept fromd.

Mormon 8:53
 53 And if they are not found, they are translated, and
their names are taken, that they may be blotted out of
his book, that no part of the book may be written of them.

Mormon 8:54
 54 Wherefore, I would speak unto all the people, yea, all
the house of Israel, yea, all the house of the Lord,
concerning the things which I have spoken unto you, and
which shall come to pass after this manner.

Mormon 8:55
 55 And it came to pass that they all spake one unto another,
saying: What meaneth these things which we have said?
Behold, are they to come to pass according to the spirit of
prophecy? or in the spirit of prophecy? for behold, it is
known that such things as have been prophesied concerning us by
the prophets are fulfilled.

Mormon 8:56
 56 And now, my son, these things which we have said, yea,
concerning the things of which we have said we shall also
say concerning the things which shall come after.

Mormon 8:57
 57 And now, my son, I will tell you concerning the prophecies of
Jerusalem. Behold, I say unto you, that the days of the Lord
Jerusalem shall be fulfilled, and Jerusalem shall be destroyed; and the
tears of anguish shall come upon them who shall render unto the Lord
Famine.

Mormon 8:58
 58 For behold, the time cometh that they shall be in a state
of many afflictions; first, because they shall be lifted up at the
feet of men; secondly, because they shall be drunken with the
alms of the poor; thirdly, because they shall be satiated with the
words of the book.

Mormon 8:59
 59 And they shall be surrounded with a marvelous work of
mercies; yea, a marvelous work of justice; yea, a marvelous
work of righteousness unto them, that they shall be saved at the
hand of the Lord.

Mormon 8:60
 60 And after this manner of language shall they be written.
And the Lord shall write them, and seal them up; and they
shall be kept from afar, and shall not find them on the
face thereof.

Mormon 8:61
 61 And then shall they be in a state of great need,
insomuch that when the Lord shall bring them forth upon the
plates of stone they shall be found of the holy and other
mighty writing; and then they shall find it upon the
plates of brass.

Mormon 8:62
 62 For thus saith the Lord: They shall be made clean in mine
yard, saith the Lord, and shall be made white in mine own
eye.

Mormon 8:63
 63 And then shall they say: Have we not read all this?
Is this not the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah?

Mormon 8:64
 64 Therefore, if the Lord God will, he will show unto me in the
yard out of which I shall pour out mine
gospel the things which shall befall such as have not come unto me
according to the spirit of prophecy.

Mormon 8:65
 65 Therefore, the Lord God will show unto me in theyard out of
which I shall pour out mine gospel the things which shall come unto
me according to the spirit of prophecy.

Mormon 8:66
 66 And then shall they say: Have we not read that which the Lord
hath commanded us, which shall befall such as have not come unto us?

Mormon 8:67
 67 And then shall they say: This is the thing which the Lord
hath commanded me; he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt read it.

Mormon 8:68
 68 And then shall they read it unto me, saying:

Mormon 8:69
 69 Behold, I have read the Book of Mormon; and if any man
believeth and is baptized, should not that be given unto him
according to the spirit of prophecy?

Mormon 8:70
 70 And then shall they say: Every word which thou seest in the
yard shall be spoken unto the Lord.

Mormon 8:71
 71 Thou shalt have no more revelations upon the face of the land until
that great work shall be brought forth unto the knowledge of the world,
that great and true work which shall be opened unto the fullness of the
knowledge of the world, that all men shall know the good and
evil of their brethren, according to their deeds.

Mormon 8:72
ce thereof.

Mormon 8:61
 61 And then shall they be in a state of great need,
insomuch that when the Lord shall bring them forth upon the
plates of stone they shall be found of the holy and other
mighty writing; and then they shall find it upon the
plates of brass.

Mormon 8:62
 62 For thus saith the Lord: They shall be made clean in mine
yard, saith the Lord, and shall be made white in mine own
eye.

Mormon 8:63
 63 And then shall they say: Have we not read all this?
Is this not the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah?

Mormon 8:64
 64 Therefore, if the Lord God will, he will show unto me in the
yard out of which I shall pour out mine
gospel the things which shall befall such as have not come unto me
according to the spirit of prophecy.

Mormon 8:65
 65 Therefore, the Lord God will show unto me in theyard out of
which I shall pour out mine gospel the things which shall come unto
me according to the spirit of prophecy.

Mormon 8:66
 66 And then shall they say: Have we not read that which the Lord
hath commanded us, which shall befall such as have not come unto us?

Mormon 8:67
 67 And then shall they say: This is the thing which the Lord
hath commanded me; he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt read it.

Mormon 8:68
 68 And then shall they read it unto me, saying:

Mormon 8:69
 69 Behold, I have read the Book of Mormon; and if any man
believeth and is baptized, should not that be given unto him
according to the spirit of prophecy?

that great work shall be brought forth unto the knowledge of the world,
that great and true work which shall be opened unto the fullness of the
knowledge of the world, that all men shall know the good and
evil of their brethren, according to their deeds.

Mormon 8:72
 72 And then shall the true and living God bring forth unto the
knowledge of the world, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which shall
be given to none other minister save it be those who have been
baptized with water.

Mormon 8:73
 73 And then shall they be brought forth unto the fullness of the
knowledge of the world; wherefore, the Lord God shall prepare a holy
and a spiritual for them; and then shall they know good from
evil; and they shall know peace from contention.

Mormon 8:74
 74 And then shall the righteous cry unto the Lord, saying:
Have I not read thy commandments?

Mormon 8:75
 75 And then shall the Lord answer him, and say: Have I not heard thee,
O house of Israel, sing to the Lord, all ye ends of the earth,

Chapter 9

Mormon 9:1
 1 And now I, Mormon, write a few of the things which
have been said by the prophets of the Lord. Behold, I mean
the words of our first parents, who were in the wilderness;

Mormon 9:2
 2 And now it came to pass that my father, Lehi, returned from
the wilderness to the land of Jerusalem.

Mormon 9:3
 3 And it came to pass that he found the sons of Ishmael in the
land of Jerusalem; and they rejoiced in the word of the Lord,
which had been spoken by their fathers.

Mormon 9:4
 4 And it came to pass that my father also rejoiced in the
word, for he knew that they should be saved.

Mormon 9:5
 5 But behold, they were not saved in this life; for behold,
their transgressions were many, as was their faith; and the
judgments which they should be subjected to at the last
day.

Mormon 9:6
 6 And my father, Lehi, being thus afflicted, therefore he
withstood the trials, and hardships, and troubles of the people
in the land, to know concerning the salvation of his
sef--

Mormon 9:7
 7 Now this he knew concerning the restoration of the
lost tribes of Israel; and the loss of their lands, and their
flocks, and herds, and their children, because of the
iniquity of their fathers.

Mormon 9:8
 8 Now it did please my father exceedingly to hear the
words of my father.

Mormon 9:9
 9 But behold, the Lord had commanded him that he should return
to the land of Jerusalem, and again the Lord would establish the
lost tribes of Israel.

Mormon 9:10
 10 And it came to pass that my father returned to the land,
and also also also my two younger sisters, who had been
perceived by the Lord100

Chapter 9

Mormon 9:1
 1 And now I, Mormon, write a few of the things which
have been said by the prophets of the Lord. Behold, I mean
the words of our first parents, who were in the wilderness;

Mormon 9:2
 2 And now it came to pass that my father, Lehi, returned from
the wilderness to the land of Jerusalem.

Mormon 9:3
 3 And it came to pass that he found the sons of Ishmael in the
land of Jerusalem; and they rejoiced in the word of the Lord,
which had been spoken by their fathers.

Mormon 9:4
 4 And it came to pass that my father also rejoiced in the
word, for he knew that they should be saved.

Mormon 9:5
 5 But behold, they were not saved in this life; for behold,
their transgressions were many, as was their faith; and the
judgments which they should be subjected to at the last
day.

Mormon 9:6
 6 And my father, Lehi, being thus afflicted, therefore he
withstood the trials, and hardships, and troubles of the people
in the land, to know concerning the salvation of his
sef--

Mormon 9:7
 7 Now this he knew concerning the restoration of the
lost tribes of Israel; and the loss of their lands, and their
flocks, and herds, and their children, because of the
iniquity of their fathers.

Mormon 9:8
 8 Now it did please my father exceedingly to hear the
words of my father.

Mormon 9:9
 9 But behold, the Lord had commanded him that he should return
to the land of Jerusalem, and again the Lord would establish the
lost tribes of Israel.

Mormon 9:10
 10 And it came to pass that my father returned to the land,
and also also also my two younger sisters, who had been
perceived by the Lord to have gone away into the wilderness.

Mormon 9:11
 11 And it came to pass that my father also returned, and
also my two younger sisters; and they rejoiced in the Lord;
and they rejoiced in the covenants of the Lord which they had
made when they returned unto the land of Jerusalem.

Mormon 9:12
 12 And it came to pass that they were desirous that they
should take their journey into the wilderness; for they
were desirous to know of the lost tribes, for they had all
perceived that the Lord had declared unto them that they should no
more return into the wilderness, but that he would establish
the lost tribes among the people.

Mormon 9:13
 13 And these are the words which my father hath written
unto them, that they should come forth, and establish the lost
tribes among the people:

Mormon 9:14
 14 Rejoice, my children, in the Lord; rejoice not in the
loss of your lands and of your possessions, but rejoice
in the restoration of your lands, and your possessions, to your
restoration.

Mormon 9:15
 15 Yea, rejoicing in the restoration of your lands, and of your
possessions, is the joy of my father; yea, this is the joy of my
father.

Mormon 9:16
 16 And now it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also
rejoiceth in the Lord; for he did wax strong in the faith of
the Lord; for he believed that the Holy One of Israel should come forth
among the sons of Ishmael; and he also believed that the Son of God should
stir up the children of men unto a knowledge of his righteousness.

Mormon 9:17
 17 And he also believed that the Holy One of Israel should cause a
preaching unto the people, that they should repent
of their sins, and learn of all this day, that they may learn from this day
of their transgression.

Mormon 9:18
 18 And now it came to pass that my father, Lehi, being thus
firm in the faith of the Lord, he began to remember the
words of his fathers; wherefore, he began to be discouraged,
because of the hardness of the hearts of the people in the land of
Zarahemla.

Mormon 9 returned, and
also my two younger sisters; and they rejoiced in the Lord;
and they rejoiced in the covenants of the Lord which they had
made when they returned unto the land of Jerusalem.

Mormon 9:12
 12 And it came to pass that they were desirous that they
should take their journey into the wilderness; for they
were desirous to know of the lost tribes, for they had all
perceived that the Lord had declared unto them that they should no
more return into the wilderness, but that he would establish
the lost tribes among the people.

Mormon 9:13
 13 And these are the words which my father hath written
unto them, that they should come forth, and establish the lost
tribes among the people:

Mormon 9:14
 14 Rejoice, my children, in the Lord; rejoice not in the
loss of your lands and of your possessions, but rejoice
in the restoration of your lands, and your possessions, to your
restoration.

Mormon 9:15
 15 Yea, rejoicing in the restoration of your lands, and of your
possessions, is the joy of my father; yea, this is the joy of my
father.

Mormon 9:16
 16 And now it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also
rejoiceth in the Lord; for he did wax strong in the faith of
the Lord; for he believed that the Holy One of Israel should come forth
among the sons of Ishmael; and he also believed that the Son of God should
stir up the children of men unto a knowledge of his righteousness.

Mormon 9:17
 17 And he also believed that the Holy One of Israel should cause a
preaching unto the people, that they should repent
of their sins, and learn of all this day, that they may learn from this day
of their transgression.

Mormon 9:18
 18 And now it came to pass that my father, Lehi, being thus
firm in the faith of the Lord, he began to remember the
words of his fathers; wherefore, he began to be discouraged,
because of the hardness of the hearts of the people in the land of
Zarahemla.

Mormon 9:19
 19 And he was desirous very much that the people should be
filled with the love of God, that they be thankful unto him for the
lands which he should possess in the land.

Mormon 9:20
 20 And he also began to ask concerning the money which he should
lay up for his army. And it came to pass that he was
determined to spend it on his own army, until he should have
expedited to the promised land.

Mormon 9:21
 21 And he spake many more wise sayings unto his people; and he
declared unto them that he went up to the promised land, and
stirred up the hearts of the people unto them that they should join
the army of the Lord.

Mormon 9:22
 22 And he also said unto them that he would be their leader and
their leader should be a man of God; wherefore, they should be his
brethren and their servants.

Mormon 9:23
 23 And he also said unto them that they should be blessed in the land,
that they should have eternal life, that they should be numbered among
the people of the Lord; and if they were desirous to be numbered among
the people of the Lord, they should be desirous to join his church;
wherefore, they should be joined.

Mormon 9:24
 24 And he also said unto them that they should be taught of
the coming of Christ, according to the spirit which should come down
among them; for thus it behooveth them, saith the Lord, they shall be taught
of that which shall come upon their brethren.

Mormon 9:25
 25 Wherefore, when my father had made an end of these words
he said unto them: Behold, here is the thing which I desired of
you in mine epistle; yea, this is the thing which I desired of you
in my last word.

Mormon 9:26
 26 And it came to pass that after he had made an end of
these sayings, he closed his epistle with these words:

Mormon 9:27
 27 And it came to pass that he closed his epistle, saying:
Behold, I am sent down to command you that the word of the Lord
shall be fulfilled, which he spake concerning the
outward of the children of men; and they shall be gatheredthe people should be
filled with the love of God, that they be thankful unto him for the
lands which he should possess in the land.

Mormon 9:20
 20 And he also began to ask concerning the money which he should
lay up for his army. And it came to pass that he was
determined to spend it on his own army, until he should have
expedited to the promised land.

Mormon 9:21
 21 And he spake many more wise sayings unto his people; and he
declared unto them that he went up to the promised land, and
stirred up the hearts of the people unto them that they should join
the army of the Lord.

Mormon 9:22
 22 And he also said unto them that he would be their leader and
their leader should be a man of God; wherefore, they should be his
brethren and their servants.

Mormon 9:23
 23 And he also said unto them that they should be blessed in the land,
that they should have eternal life, that they should be numbered among
the people of the Lord; and if they were desirous to be numbered among
the people of the Lord, they should be desirous to join his church;
wherefore, they should be joined.

Mormon 9:24
 24 And he also said unto them that they should be taught of
the coming of Christ, according to the spirit which should come down
among them; for thus it behooveth them, saith the Lord, they shall be taught
of that which shall come upon their brethren.

Mormon 9:25
 25 Wherefore, when my father had made an end of these words
he said unto them: Behold, here is the thing which I desired of
you in mine epistle; yea, this is the thing which I desired of you
in my last word.

Mormon 9:26
 26 And it came to pass that after he had made an end of
these sayings, he closed his epistle with these words:

Mormon 9:27
 27 And it came to pass that he closed his epistle, saying:
Behold, I am sent down to command you that the word of the Lord
shall be fulfilled, which he spake concerning the
outward of the children of men; and they shall be gathered together
in the church of God; and all these things which he spake
concerning them is fulfilled.

Mormon 9:28
 28 And now, O my son, what have ye to do with this word
of the Lord which he has spoken? Behold, he hath told you
concerning yourselves that ye should gather together in the
church of God all men, and let them come unto the knowledge of your
father, that they may be perfected in him, that he hath no
more need to exert himself upon the flesh.

Mormon 9:29
 29 Wherefore, my son, do not let this enter into your heart,
nor the judge this flesh, that the shedding of the blood of
Christ shall not be among you. But my son, I send for thy bread,
according to thy desire; and I will write thy garments. But I send
for my cloak also, according to thy desire. And I write thee
again, my son. But this shall be thy last write.

Mormon 9:30
 30 And it came to pass that after my father had made an end
of these sayings unto the people, he also began to write unto
his mother, Sariah.

Mormon 9:31
 31 And it came to pass that he departed from there into the
wilderness.

Mormon 9:32
 32 And it came to pass in that same year, there began to be a great
war between the Nephites and the Lamanites--

Mormon 9:33
 33 Between the Nephites and the Lamanites over the land of
Mulek; and thus ended the twenty and third year of the reign of the
judges.

Mormon 9:34
 34 And in the twenty and fourth year, the people of Limhi and
of his people, who had gathered together in the land of Mulek,
began to be alarmed because of the people of Moroni. And
many of the people of Limhi and of his people were taken and brought
before the judge. And Moroni commanded that they should be judged.

Mormon 9:35
 35 And now this was done in the very height of the heathen persecution
between the Nephites and the Lamanites; but it was in the
wilderness--not among the people whom Moroni commanded them to be
judged.
 they shall be gathered together
in the church of God; and all these things which he spake
concerning them is fulfilled.

Mormon 9:28
 28 And now, O my son, what have ye to do with this word
of the Lord which he has spoken? Behold, he hath told you
concerning yourselves that ye should gather together in the
church of God all men, and let them come unto the knowledge of your
father, that they may be perfected in him, that he hath no
more need to exert himself upon the flesh.

Mormon 9:29
 29 Wherefore, my son, do not let this enter into your heart,
nor the judge this flesh, that the shedding of the blood of
Christ shall not be among you. But my son, I send for thy bread,
according to thy desire; and I will write thy garments. But I send
for my cloak also, according to thy desire. And I write thee
again, my son. But this shall be thy last write.

Mormon 9:30
 30 And it came to pass that after my father had made an end
of these sayings unto the people, he also began to write unto
his mother, Sariah.

Mormon 9:31
 31 And it came to pass that he departed from there into the
wilderness.

Mormon 9:32
 32 And it came to pass in that same year, there began to be a great
war between the Nephites and the Lamanites--

Mormon 9:33
 33 Between the Nephites and the Lamanites over the land of
Mulek; and thus ended the twenty and third year of the reign of the
judges.

Mormon 9:34
 34 And in the twenty and fourth year, the people of Limhi and
of his people, who had gathered together in the land of Mulek,
began to be alarmed because of the people of Moroni. And
many of the people of Limhi and of his people were taken and brought
before the judge. And Moroni commanded that they should be judged.

Mormon 9:35
 35 And now this was done in the very height of the heathen persecution
between the Nephites and the Lamanites; but it was in the
wilderness--not among the people whom Moroni commanded them to be
judged.

Mormon 9:36
 36 For it came to pass that Moroni said unto them: Behold, whither
are we going, that our garments may be burned with fire? For
we have not washed our garments at the waters of Mulek; and we
have not washed our garments before the presence of the Lord;
and the Lord hath commanded us to do this.

Mormon 9:37
 37 Behold, we know that the Lord hath commanded us to do this;
yea, we know that the Lord hath commanded us to do this. And
now we do this; and the Lord hath commanded us to do this; and
we do this; and the Lord hath commanded us to do this; and
we do this.

Mormon 9:38
 38 And behold, we did this; and the Lord hath commanded us
that we should bring forth our records, that he may know of
their surety and their propriety; and we do this.

Mormon 9:39
 39 And now, I do not write all the words which Moroni commanded me,
but the words which he commanded me. But he said unto me: Write these
things which thou hast written, and seal up the records which thou hast
written, and make them safe; for behold, the records which thou hast
written I do seal up; therefore, they are hid, and I do not
write them.

Mormon 9:40
 40 And I know that the Lord will not suffer that I should destroy
the records which I have written; therefore, I write these things
that he may know of them.

Mormon 9:41
 41 And I write them that he may know of their surety and
their propriety; for I know that they are not lost; for I have
written them.

Mormon 9:42
 42 Wherefore, I write them as a testimony that they are hid
from the prying eyes of men; and the record which thou hast
written I seal up and seal up; therefore I do not write.

Mormon 9:43
 43 And I know that the records which I have written are
unto the Lord; and he will show unto me, that because I
have written them, he knows of them; for he spake many
things unto me, and he hath written them all.

mmanded them to be
judged.

Mormon 9:36
 36 For it came to pass that Moroni said unto them: Behold, whither
are we going, that our garments may be burned with fire? For
we have not washed our garments at the waters of Mulek; and we
have not washed our garments before the presence of the Lord;
and the Lord hath commanded us to do this.

Mormon 9:37
 37 Behold, we know that the Lord hath commanded us to do this;
yea, we know that the Lord hath commanded us to do this. And
now we do this; and the Lord hath commanded us to do this; and
we do this; and the Lord hath commanded us to do this; and
we do this.

Mormon 9:38
 38 And behold, we did this; and the Lord hath commanded us
that we should bring forth our records, that he may know of
their surety and their propriety; and we do this.

Mormon 9:39
 39 And now, I do not write all the words which Moroni commanded me,
but the words which he commanded me. But he said unto me: Write these
things which thou hast written, and seal up the records which thou hast
written, and make them safe; for behold, the records which thou hast
written I do seal up; therefore, they are hid, and I do not
write them.

Mormon 9:40
 40 And I know that the Lord will not suffer that I should destroy
the records which I have written; therefore, I write these things
that he may know of them.

Mormon 9:41
 41 And I write them that he may know of their surety and
their propriety; for I know that they are not lost; for I have
written them.

Mormon 9:42
 42 Wherefore, I write them as a testimony that they are hid
from the prying eyes of men; and the record which thou hast
written I seal up and seal up; therefore I do not write.

Mormon 9:43

unto the Lord; and he will show unto me, that because I
have written them, he knows of them; for he spake many
things unto me, and he hath written them all.




THE BOOK OF MORMON

The record which is written by the mouth of Moroni, taken from the
record of Alma in the Book of Mormon.

Moroni 1
Chapter 1

Moroni 1:1
 1 Now I, Moroni, do not write all the words of my father
immediately following his coming into the world. But as
I have written many things which have been taken away by the
hand of the Lord,

the interpretation thereof I have not written. But it sufficeth me
to write them.

Moroni 1:2
 2 Behold, I am commanded to write the words which my father hath
written.

Moroni 1:3
 3 And now my brethren, I write a few of the words of my father's
words which he hath written in the record which I have made
of my father.

Moroni 1:4
 4 But behold, I do not write them all, neither have I the
desires of my beloved brethren; but they are written, and
sealed up in a manner that they cannot be read.

Moroni 1:5
 5 But I write them that the interpretation thereof may be
made known among all people, by the power of the Holy
Ghost; therefore I seal up these things which I write in the
record which I have made.

Moroni 1:6
 6 Behold, I am commanded to write them according to the
commandments of God. But behold, I am forbidden; for hearken not
unto the voice of the Lord, neither do I believe that I am
worthy to speak the words of my father. But behold, I know
that it is the Lord who hath commanded me to write them.

Moroni 1:7
 7 And I know that in the Lord God will I execute judgment upon
all those who have done iniquity, both in word and in deed;
even upon them that have repented not, but have murdered,
planted, and eaten away the fruit of the trees of the forest,
and made themselves drink the poison which they had prepared.

Moroni 1:8
 8 Behold, I write them because of the wickedness
of men. Yea, I write them because of the wickedness
of kings, because of their iniquity, and because of their
itten them all.




THE BOOK OF MORMON

The record which is written by the mouth of Moroni, taken from the
record of Alma in the Book of Mormon.

Moroni 1
Chapter 1

Moroni 1:1
 1 Now I, Moroni, do not write all the words of my father
immediately following his coming into the world. But as
I have written many things which have been taken away by the
hand of the Lord,

the interpretation thereof I have not written. But it sufficeth me
to write them.

Moroni 1:2
 2 Behold, I am commanded to write the words which my father hath
written.

Moroni 1:3
 3 And now my brethren, I write a few of the words of my father's
words which he hath written in the record which I have made
of my father.

Moroni 1:4
 4 But behold, I do not write them all, neither have I the
desires of my beloved brethren; but they are written, and
sealed up in a manner that they cannot be read.

Moroni 1:5
 5 But I write them that the interpretation thereof may be
made known among all people, by the power of the Holy
Ghost; therefore I seal up these things which I write in the
record which I have made.

Moroni 1:6
 6 Behold, I am commanded to write them according to the
commandments of God. But behold, I am forbidden; for hearken not
unto the voice of the Lord, neither do I believe that I am
worthy to speak the words of my father. But behold, I know
that it is the Lord who hath commanded me to write them.

Moroni 1:7
 7 And I know that in the Lord God will I execute judgment upon
all those who have done iniquity, both in word and in deed;
even upon them that have repented not, but have murdered,
planted, and eaten away the fruit of the trees of the forest,
and made themselves drink the poison which they had prepared.

Moroni 1:8
 8 Behold, I write them because of the wickedness
of men. Yea, I write them because of the wickedness
of kings, because of their iniquity, and because of their
covering their tracks with the blood of the saints.

Moroni 1:9
 9 Yea, I write them because of their conceitedness,
and because of their pride, which brought them to commit
harlots.

Moroni 1:10
 10 Behold, I write them because of the desire of their
heads to be lifted up, and their hearts to be lifted up, that
they may be esteemed of men.

Moroni 1:11
 11 Behold, I write them because of the pride of men, and
the vanity of their hearts, which is great hearkening
unto the voice of the foolish and foolish, that they
may be led away by the vain things of the eyes;

Moroni 1:12
 12 And that they may be esteemed of no man, that they may
be no more worthy of the mention of the Lord their
God, which things are, or which things are to come; for they
are spoken of no man.

Moroni 1:13
 13 Behold, I write them because that I know them not they
proceed to prophesy of many things which are to come.

Moroni 1:14
 14 Now these are written according to the commandment of the
Lord; for behold, he hath given me commandment that I should write
them.

Moroni 1:15
 15 And behold, I have written them; and I know of these things
which have been taken away.

Moroni 1:16
 16 Behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should write
them; and I know them, because I have had many things
written unto me.

Moroni 1:17
 17 Behold, I know the things which have been written by the
mouth of the prophets, for they are written in the book of
the Lamb; and they are written in the hearts of the children
of men.

Moroni 1:18
 18 Behold, I know the things which the Lord hath made known unto
me; for I know the things of my father, and also the things
which have been manifested unto me by the power of the
Holy Ghost.

Moroni 1:19
 19 Behold, I know the covenant which my father hath
made; and he hath calved sons; and he hath also given them
breasts; and they are touse of their
covering their tracks with the blood of the saints.

Moroni 1:9
 9 Yea, I write them because of their conceitedness,
and because of their pride, which brought them to commit
harlots.

Moroni 1:10
 10 Behold, I write them because of the desire of their
heads to be lifted up, and their hearts to be lifted up, that
they may be esteemed of men.

Moroni 1:11
 11 Behold, I write them because of the pride of men, and
the vanity of their hearts, which is great hearkening
unto the voice of the foolish and foolish, that they
may be led away by the vain things of the eyes;

Moroni 1:12
 12 And that they may be esteemed of no man, that they may
be no more worthy of the mention of the Lord their
God, which things are, or which things are to come; for they
are spoken of no man.

Moroni 1:13
 13 Behold, I write them because that I know them not they
proceed to prophesy of many things which are to come.

Moroni 1:14
 14 Now these are written according to the commandment of the
Lord; for behold, he hath given me commandment that I should write
them.

Moroni 1:15
 15 And behold, I have written them; and I know of these things
which have been taken away.

Moroni 1:16
 16 Behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should write
them; and I know them, because I have had many things
written unto me.

Moroni 1:17
 17 Behold, I know the things which have been written by the
mouth of the prophets, for they are written in the book of
the Lamb; and they are written in the hearts of the children
of men.

Moroni 1:18
 18 Behold, I know the things which the Lord hath made known unto
me; for I know the things of my father, and also the things
which have been manifested unto me by the power of the
Holy Ghost.

Moroni 1:19
 19 Behold, I know the covenant which my father hath
made; and he hath calved sons; and he hath also given them
breasts; and they are to be hid from the men of the
earth.

Moroni 1:20
 20 Behold, I know the covenant which my father hath
made; and he hath commanded me to write them. And behold
they are written in the book of the Lamb; and the book which
I have made it, I know unto you, saith the Lamb.

Moroni 1:21
 21 And it shall come to pass that the book which I
know of shall be made known unto all nations; and all nations,
saith the Lamb.

Moroni 1:22
 22 And it shall come to pass that the book which I know of
shall be made known unto all the kings of the earth; and all
kings shall read the things which are written in the book
of the Lamb.

Moroni 1:23
 23 And they who read the things which are written in
the book of the Lamb shall also be instructed of the Lamb,
according to their desires concerning that which they should read.

Moroni 1:24
 24 And all this shall be done, says the Lamb, that they may behold
the many ways of men that they have been led away.

Moroni 1:25
 25 For behold, the Lord God hath shown unto me in a vision
concerning that which should come upon the earth.

Moroni 1:26
 26 Yea, he said unto me: What actions, if any, of mine
should take, that would lead away the hearts of all the nations of
the earth to unbelief?

Moroni 1:27
 27 And he also hath declared unto me concerning the destruction of
his people. And he hath said: If there should be any of my
people who should do that which was written, they would
be destroyed.

Moroni 1:28
 28 And it came to pass that I looked
concernedly round about, for behold, a man had been
wrought upon whom had been slain all those who had
written the things of the prophets; and also the
books which had been handed upon them.

Moroni 1:29
 29 And my soul did labour exceedingly, to learn of
him that he should be saved; but it was vain; for
he was slain by his own people.

Moroni 1:30
 30 And it came to pass that I looked hid from the men of the
earth.

Moroni 1:20
 20 Behold, I know the covenant which my father hath
made; and he hath commanded me to write them. And behold
they are written in the book of the Lamb; and the book which
I have made it, I know unto you, saith the Lamb.

Moroni 1:21
 21 And it shall come to pass that the book which I
know of shall be made known unto all nations; and all nations,
saith the Lamb.

Moroni 1:22
 22 And it shall come to pass that the book which I know of
shall be made known unto all the kings of the earth; and all
kings shall read the things which are written in the book
of the Lamb.

Moroni 1:23
 23 And they who read the things which are written in
the book of the Lamb shall also be instructed of the Lamb,
according to their desires concerning that which they should read.

Moroni 1:24
 24 And all this shall be done, says the Lamb, that they may behold
the many ways of men that they have been led away.

Moroni 1:25
 25 For behold, the Lord God hath shown unto me in a vision
concerning that which should come upon the earth.

Moroni 1:26
 26 Yea, he said unto me: What actions, if any, of mine
should take, that would lead away the hearts of all the nations of
the earth to unbelief?

Moroni 1:27
 27 And he also hath declared unto me concerning the destruction of
his people. And he hath said: If there should be any of my
people who should do that which was written, they would
be destroyed.

Moroni 1:28
 28 And it came to pass that I looked
concernedly round about, for behold, a man had been
wrought upon whom had been slain all those who had
written the things of the prophets; and also the
books which had been handed upon them.

Moroni 1:29
 29 And my soul did labour exceedingly, to learn of
him that he should be saved; but it was vain; for
he was slain by his own people.

Moroni 1:30
 30 And it came to pass that I looked round about again
temporarily; and I beheld a man, and he was speaking
concerning the things which I had heard and seen.

Moroni 1:31
 31 And I beheld him, and he also beheld me, and said unto
me: What is this that thou hast beheld in the vision--the
destruction of thy people, yea, even the city of
Jerusalem?

Moroni 1:32
 32 And I said unto him: What is this that thou hast beheld
concerning the destruction of Jerusalem? Behold, it is the
destruction of a people.

Moroni 1:33
 33 And he said unto me: This is the account which we have had
between the fathers of our people, the prophets of the
Lord.

Moroni 1:34
 34 And it is the account which we have had between the
fathers of our people, the dispossessed of their lands, that
the Lord God should destroy his people.

Moroni 1:35
 35 And it is the account which we have had from the
fathers of our people, the kings of the land of Jerusalem;
for I know that they have gathered together their people,
saith the Lamb, and they are dispersed throughout all
the lands of the earth.

Moroni 1:36
 36 And now it came to pass that I, Moroni, cried unto my
father, saying: Behold, I have peaceable grounds for supposing that
I, Moroni, had obtained a greater understanding with my
father, who was the king of the land.

Moroni 1:37
 37 But behold, he hardened his heart, and said unto me: Behold, I
know that ye know that my people who are in the land of
Jerusalem are the sons of Zion.

Moroni 1:38
 38 And now, behold, I know of a surety that they are not; for
the servant of the house of Israel hath not as yet been among them;
nevertheless, I know that a strong and mighty God hath sent his
elder brother among them, and he hath brought again the covenants of
the Lord which he had made unto his father.

Moroni 1:39
 39 Now I, Moroni, did contend with my father, that he
should not write the revelations which had been given by his
father again
temporarily; and I beheld a man, and he was speaking
concerning the things which I had heard and seen.

Moroni 1:31
 31 And I beheld him, and he also beheld me, and said unto
me: What is this that thou hast beheld in the vision--the
destruction of thy people, yea, even the city of
Jerusalem?

Moroni 1:32
 32 And I said unto him: What is this that thou hast beheld
concerning the destruction of Jerusalem? Behold, it is the
destruction of a people.

Moroni 1:33
 33 And he said unto me: This is the account which we have had
between the fathers of our people, the prophets of the
Lord.

Moroni 1:34
 34 And it is the account which we have had between the
fathers of our people, the dispossessed of their lands, that
the Lord God should destroy his people.

Moroni 1:35
 35 And it is the account which we have had from the
fathers of our people, the kings of the land of Jerusalem;
for I know that they have gathered together their people,
saith the Lamb, and they are dispersed throughout all
the lands of the earth.

Moroni 1:36
 36 And now it came to pass that I, Moroni, cried unto my
father, saying: Behold, I have peaceable grounds for supposing that
I, Moroni, had obtained a greater understanding with my
father, who was the king of the land.

Moroni 1:37
 37 But behold, he hardened his heart, and said unto me: Behold, I
know that ye know that my people who are in the land of
Jerusalem are the sons of Zion.

Moroni 1:38
 38 And now, behold, I know of a surety that they are not; for
the servant of the house of Israel hath not as yet been among them;
nevertheless, I know that a strong and mighty God hath sent his
elder brother among them, and he hath brought again the covenants of
the Lord which he had made unto his father.

Moroni 1:39
 39 Now I, Moroni, did contend with my father, that he
should not write the revelations which had been given by his
father, which were recorded among the plates of brass; but I
saith unto you, that he hath written them, and that they
are true; for behold, they contain all the thoughts,
concerning us and our future state.

Moroni 1:40
 40 And I also testify unto you, my son, that my father has
testified these things unto me, and I do believe him.

Moroni 2
Chapter 2

Moroni 2:1
 1 I, Moroni, having been commanded of God that I should deliver up the
record which my father had made, I have delivered it up into the
hands of my son, who is the son of Alma. And I do want
to know the cause whereby he is preserved; for he hath been
wrought upon and cast into prison by the power of the
Lamanites, and he hath suffered himself to be slain by their
slaughterers.

Moroni 2:2
 2 But behold, I will show unto thee a cause whereby he can be
wrought upon and cast out of prison; for I will show unto thee
concerning the record which is engraven upon the plates of
brass.

Moroni 2:3
 3 Behold, I will show unto thee that the record which my father
hath made is a record of our people, who were once a people
of the land; but they have been driven, yea, even even
scattered and scattered far away from the land, yea, even
out of their lands, yea, even out of the land of their
first inheritance.

Moroni 2:4
 4 And behold, also, I will show unto thee the record which my
father hath made, which is a record of the people of our
first inheritance; and it is written by the finger of the
Lord; and behold, it is a record which knows no alteration.

Moroni 2:5
 5 Behold, I will show unto thee a thing which is not written,
that will make thy soul happy.

Moroni 2:6
 6 Know ye not that these things are a type and a shadow of
a great and a marvelous work?

Moroni 2:7
 7 Behold, the work of the Lord is as plain and as
merciful as the sound of a trumpet? Behold, how sweet
given by his
father, which were recorded among the plates of brass; but I
saith unto you, that he hath written them, and that they
are true; for behold, they contain all the thoughts,
concerning us and our future state.

Moroni 1:40
 40 And I also testify unto you, my son, that my father has
testified these things unto me, and I do believe him.

Moroni 2
Chapter 2

Moroni 2:1
 1 I, Moroni, having been commanded of God that I should deliver up the
record which my father had made, I have delivered it up into the
hands of my son, who is the son of Alma. And I do want
to know the cause whereby he is preserved; for he hath been
wrought upon and cast into prison by the power of the
Lamanites, and he hath suffered himself to be slain by their

Moroni 2:2
 2 But behold, I will show unto thee a cause whereby he can be
wrought upon and cast out of prison; for I will show unto thee
concerning the record which is engraven upon the plates of
brass.

Moroni 2:3
 3 Behold, I will show unto thee that the record which my father
hath made is a record of our people, who were once a people
of the land; but they have been driven, yea, even even
scattered and scattered far away from the land, yea, even
out of their lands, yea, even out of the land of their

Moroni 2:4
 4 And behold, also, I will show unto thee the record which my
father hath made, which is a record of the people of our
first inheritance; and it is written by the finger of the
Lord; and behold, it is a record which knows no alteration.

Moroni 2:5
 5 Behold, I will show unto thee a thing which is not written,
that will make thy soul happy.

Moroni 2:6
 6 Know ye not that these things are a type and a shadow of
a great and a marvelous work?

Moroni 2:7
 7 Behold, the work of the Lord is as plain and as
merciful as the sound of a trumpet? Behold, how sweet
is the sound of a trumpet to the ears of a man who is
scattered far and wide among all nations?

Moroni 2:8
 8 Yea, how sweet to him that has sorrow, and is poor, and
is hunger-stricken, and is naked, and is sick, and is of the
pest, and is without hope or end, is the nakedness of the
naked!

Moroni 2:9
 9 Behold, how sweet to him that cometh of them is the
poverty of the hungry, and the nakedness of the naked!

Moroni 2:10
 10 And it shall come to pass in that day that the nakedness
of the naked shall be a type of the nakedness of his people--

Moroni 2:11
 11 And all this, and more.

Moroni 2:12
 12 Therefore, my son, I would that ye should understand that the
series of events which is in my father hath been a type
of things to come; and many more things do I mean.

Moroni 2:13
 13 And I know by this that my father meaneth all his words which he
brought out of the mouth of the Jew; for he truly saw the
mirrors and the powers of God as he always had done.

Moroni 2:14
 14 And he also saw the things of his father and of the
gods in the flesh; and he also spake concerning the
things of the children of men, which shall come upon them.

Moroni 2:15
 15 And it shall come to pass that they shall remember the
things of my father, and shall seek to do his will, for he
hath done his will.

Moroni 2:16
 16 Therefore, my son, I know that my father meaneth all
his words which he hath spoken, for he meaneth all things;
for there is nothing mean in all things.

Moroni 2:17
 17 Behold, I am he that meant them. Behold, I am he that
measured them; for there were many that were of the
seed of my father.

Moroni 2:18
 18 But he that was of the seed of my father was of
the church of God; yea, he was a holy maker of heaven and
earth, that brought forthciful as the sound of a trumpet? Behold, how sweet
is the sound of a trumpet to the ears of a man who is
scattered far and wide among all nations?

Moroni 2:8
 8 Yea, how sweet to him that has sorrow, and is poor, and
is hunger-stricken, and is naked, and is sick, and is of the
pest, and is without hope or end, is the nakedness of the
naked!

Moroni 2:9
 9 Behold, how sweet to him that cometh of them is the
poverty of the hungry, and the nakedness of the naked!

Moroni 2:10
 10 And it shall come to pass in that day that the nakedness
of the naked shall be a type of the nakedness of his people--

Moroni 2:11
 11 And all this, and more.

Moroni 2:12
 12 Therefore, my son, I would that ye should understand that the
series of events which is in my father hath been a type
of things to come; and many more things do I mean.

Moroni 2:13
 13 And I know by this that my father meaneth all his words which he
brought out of the mouth of the Jew; for he truly saw the
mirrors and the powers of God as he always had done.

Moroni 2:14
 14 And he also saw the things of his father and of the
gods in the flesh; and he also spake concerning the
things of the children of men, which shall come upon them.

Moroni 2:15
 15 And it shall come to pass that they shall remember the
things of my father, and shall seek to do his will, for he
hath done his will.

Moroni 2:16
 16 Therefore, my son, I know that my father meaneth all
his words which he hath spoken, for he meaneth all things;
for there is nothing mean in all things.

Moroni 2:17
 17 Behold, I am he that meant them. Behold, I am he that
measured them; for there were many that were of the
seed of my father.

Moroni 2:18
 18 But he that was of the seed of my father was of
the church of God; yea, he was a holy maker of heaven and
earth, that brought forth all things according to his word.

Moroni 2:19
 19 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am put out of the way of his
way, that I am not worthy to speak his words.

Moroni 2:20
 20 And I speak according to the words of my father,
according to the things which are written.

Moroni 2:21
 21 Behold, I know my father hath spoken many things unto
my father; wherefore, he hath commanded me to speak.

Moroni 2:22
 22 And yet, I speak not all the words of my father.
For behold, he hath taught me that which I have
learned, that I should speak many things unto my
father, which he hath translated by the power of his
Holy Ghost.

Moroni 2:23
 23 And now, my son, I have spoken somewhat concerning those
things which my father hath taught me.

Moroni 2:24
 24 Behold, I truly testified of the things which I have
learned; and if it were not so, my father, even he
would not have taught me these things. But behold, he
testified of them, and also many things which he hath testified
of.

Moroni 2:25
 25 And I know that my father and all the holy prophets of the
Gentiles have testified of these things; and they have made
known unto me the things which they have heard.

Moroni 2:26
 26 And now, my son, I would speak somewhat concerning these
things, that thou mayest have all the revelations of the Master unto
thou, which are for the intent to teach, yea, which are given
unto all men.

Moroni 2:27
 27 And behold, I speak unto all the ends of the earth; for I know
that thou wouldst all that thou hast, even up unto this time.

Moroni 2:28
 28 Wherefore, thou shalt receive the fulness of the fullness
of the gospel of Christ unto thee, by the power of the Holy
Ghost.

Moroni 2:29
 29 And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth, for I know
that thou wouldst have all the revelations of the holy
miracle given unto theerth all things according to his word.

Moroni 2:19
 19 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am put out of the way of his
way, that I am not worthy to speak his words.

Moroni 2:20
 20 And I speak according to the words of my father,
according to the things which are written.

Moroni 2:21
 21 Behold, I know my father hath spoken many things unto
my father; wherefore, he hath commanded me to speak.

Moroni 2:22
 22 And yet, I speak not all the words of my father.
For behold, he hath taught me that which I have
learned, that I should speak many things unto my
father, which he hath translated by the power of his
Holy Ghost.

Moroni 2:23
 23 And now, my son, I have spoken somewhat concerning those
things which my father hath taught me.

 24 Behold, I truly testified of the things which I have
learned; and if it were not so, my father, even he
would not have taught me these things. But behold, he
testified of them, and also many things which he hath testified
of.

Moroni 2:25
 25 And I know that my father and all the holy prophets of the
Gentiles have testified of these things; and they have made
known unto me the things which they have heard.

things, that thou mayest have all the revelations of the Master unto
thou, which are for the intent to teach, yea, which are given
unto all men.

Moroni 2:27
 27 And behold, I speak unto all the ends of the earth; for I know
that thou wouldst all that thou hast, even up unto this time.

Moroni 2:28
 28 Wherefore, thou shalt receive the fulness of the fullness
of the gospel of Christ unto thee, by the power of the Holy
Ghost.

Moroni 2:29
 29 And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth, for I know
that thou wouldst have all the revelations of the holy
miracle given unto thee, had not the Lord shown unto thee, by the
power of the Holy Ghost.

Moroni 2:30
 30 And I know that thou wouldst have them given unto thee; but,
notwithstanding this, thou shalt have the gift of the Holy
Ghost.

Moroni 2:31
 31 And now I speak unto all men, for I know by the
gift of the Holy Ghost that all men must perish except they must
gift themselves unto him, if they will fall into transgression.

Moroni 2:32
 32 Wherefore, I speak unto all men, by the gift of the Holy
Ghost, which gift is given unto all men; yea, the gift
of the Holy Ghost, which gift cometh from God, the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, which is one God, witness unto
men.

Moroni 2:33
 33 And now, I speak unto all men, by the gift of the Holy
Ghost, and the Father alone, that they may know concerning the
coming of Christ, and also concerning the restoration of the Jews
from the utter destruction which they have suffered.

Moroni 2:34
 34 And my son, could ye be so bold as to believe in the
gifts of God, and also in the restoration of the Jews, at the
time that the Jews shall again be gathered together in this land,
from the four quarters of the earth; yea, I say, could ye be so
curious as to know concerning the restoration of the Jews from
the utter destruction which they have suffered, which is the result of
their transgression, in the days of Christ--

Moroni 2:35
 35 In the days of the Messiah, who shall come, they shall be gathered
together in one body, from the four quarters of the earth, from the
four quarters of the earth.

Moroni 2:36
 36 And then shall the four quarters be filled with the children
of men, from the east and from the west, and from the north and
from the south; and they shall be gathered together in one.

Moroni 2:37
 37 And afterward shall the four quarters be exhausted; and the
children of men shall be desolation.

Moroni 2:38
 38 And after this manner shall the four quarters of the earth be
filled; and after this manner shall they be scattered.

Moroni 2:39
 that thou wouldst have them given unto thee; but,
notwithstanding this, thou shalt have the gift of the Holy
Ghost.

Moroni 2:31
 31 And now I speak unto all men, for I know by the
gift of the Holy Ghost that all men must perish except they must
gift themselves unto him, if they will fall into transgression.

Moroni 2:32
 32 Wherefore, I speak unto all men, by the gift of the Holy
Ghost, which gift is given unto all men; yea, the gift
of the Holy Ghost, which gift cometh from God, the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, which is one God, witness unto
men.

Moroni 2:33
 33 And now, I speak unto all men, by the gift of the Holy
Ghost, and the Father alone, that they may know concerning the
coming of Christ, and also concerning the restoration of the Jews
from the utter destruction which they have suffered.

Moroni 2:34
 34 And my son, could ye be so bold as to believe in the
gifts of God, and also in the restoration of the Jews, at the
time that the Jews shall again be gathered together in this land,
from the four quarters of the earth; yea, I say, could ye be so
curious as to know concerning the restoration of the Jews from
the utter destruction which they have suffered, which is the result of
their transgression, in the days of Christ--

Moroni 2:35
 35 In the days of the Messiah, who shall come, they shall be gathered
together in one body, from the four quarters of the earth, from the
four quarters of the earth.

Moroni 2:36
 36 And then shall the four quarters be filled with the children
of men, from the east and from the west, and from the north and
from the south; and they shall be gathered together in one.

Moroni 2:37
 37 And afterward shall the four quarters be exhausted; and the
children of men shall be desolation.

Moroni 2:38
 38 And after this manner shall the four quarters of the earth be
filled; and after this manner shall they be scattered.

Moroni 2:39
 39 And after they shall be scattered by the winds and the
quaking of the earth, they shall be gathered together again in the
land of Zarahemla, and shall be taught of the Lord; yea, and they
shall be taught of the Lord that they are of the house of
Israel, and that they have been taught by their fathers away
from all the lands of their iniquity; that the Lord hath
mercifully delivered them out of the hands of all their
enemies, yea, and from bondage even to the lands of their
iniquity.

Moroni 2:40
 40 And now I say unto you that after this manner shall they be
gathered together, that the Lord God may show forth his power, according
to that which he hath prepared.

Moroni 2:41
 41 And then shall the words of Isaiah, which were
spoken by the mouth of the prophet, which were spoken
concerning the restoration of the Jews from captivity--in the
land of Zarahemla, thou shalt restore the word of the Lord
unto them, that they may be restored again to the lands of their
iniquity.

Moroni 2:42
 42 Behold, I say unto you that even during the forty and
sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Israel, or even during the fifty and sixth year of the
restoration of the people of Judah from captivity, they
did still remain in a state of unbelief; and the Lord
God did not show forth his power unto them, because of
their iniquity.

Moroni 2:43
 43 Wherefore, the Lord God did show forth his power unto them,
according to the words of Isaiah, according to the captivity of
their fathers.

Moroni 3
Chapter 3

Moroni 3:1
 1 For behold, I have read many things unto you, my son, and
I have pondered many things which are written; and I have
remembered the words of Isaiah; and I have consulted
the words of Samuel; and my heart has been taught by the
words of Samuel.

Moroni 3:2
 2 And I have searched the prophecies and the
scriptures of the prophets, that I might know concerning
the restoration of the Jews from captivity.

Moroni 3:3
 3 And I have labored diligently among the people of
Israel, that I might knowng of the earth, they shall be gathered together again in the
land of Zarahemla, and shall be taught of the Lord; yea, and they
shall be taught of the Lord that they are of the house of
Israel, and that they have been taught by their fathers away
from all the lands of their iniquity; that the Lord hath
mercifully delivered them out of the hands of all their
enemies, yea, and from bondage even to the lands of their
iniquity.

Moroni 2:40
 40 And now I say unto you that after this manner shall they be
gathered together, that the Lord God may show forth his power, according
to that which he hath prepared.

Moroni 2:41
 41 And then shall the words of Isaiah, which were
spoken by the mouth of the prophet, which were spoken
concerning the restoration of the Jews from captivity--in the
land of Zarahemla, thou shalt restore the word of the Lord
unto them, that they may be restored again to the lands of their
iniquity.

Moroni 2:42
 42 Behold, I say unto you that even during the forty and
sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Israel, or even during the fifty and sixth year of the
restoration of the people of Judah from captivity, they
did still remain in a state of unbelief; and the Lord
God did not show forth his power unto them, because of
their iniquity.

Moroni 2:43
 43 Wherefore, the Lord God did show forth his power unto them,
according to the words of Isaiah, according to the captivity of
their fathers.

I have pondered many things which are written; and I have
remembered the words of Isaiah; and I have consulted
the words of Samuel; and my heart has been taught by the
words of Samuel.

Moroni 3:2
 2 And I have searched the prophecies and the
scriptures of the prophets, that I might know concerning
the restoration of the Jews from captivity.

Moroni 3:3
 3 And I have labored diligently among the people of
Israel, that I might know concerning the plan of the
Lord which he hath laid upon the foundations of the earth;
and also concerning the restoration of the two tribes of
Israel, the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Naphtali,
which had been destroyed because of their iniquity.

Moroni 3:4
 4 Behold, I have read the prophecies of all the holy
prophets, from Jacob down to the end of the world; wherefore,
I have labored in the temple which was built by the Lord,
according to the word of the Lord; and I have put my trust
in the Lord continually, that I might know concerning the
restoration of the Jews from captivity.

Moroni 3:5
 5 And I know that the Lord will restore them, for he grieveth
them not, neither shall they sorrow save they shall repent and
seek no more to destroy my soul.

Moroni 3:6
 6 Behold, I am numbered among the people of the church of
God; and I hope that my soul shall be restored unto me, according
to the word of the Lord which I have spoken.

Moroni 3:7
 7 Behold, the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Hebrew
language unto the nations; and I will set it up as a heritage unto
my people.

Moroni 3:8
 8 And behold, the Lord hath said also: I will bring forth
my Hebrew language unto all the nations which shall believe on my name;
wherefore, the Jews shall have a right over them that do believe
on my name.

Moroni 3:9
 9 And behold, the Lord hath said also: I will make a Hebrew
language the heritage of the Jews.

Moroni 3:10
 10 And behold, the Lord hath said also: I will make up a
rash, a language the children of men to understand.

Moroni 3:11
 11 Behold, the Lord hath said also: I will cause a
language to be taught unto all the nations which shall believe
on my name; and I will clothe it with the language of the
earth.

Moroni 3:12
 12 Behold, I am he who made them like unto men, that
they shall speak a mean, a dumb, and a dumb dumb
language.

Moroni 3:ntly among the people of
Israel, that I might know concerning the plan of the
Lord which he hath laid upon the foundations of the earth;
and also concerning the restoration of the two tribes of
Israel, the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Naphtali,
which had been destroyed because of their iniquity.

Moroni 3:4
 4 Behold, I have read the prophecies of all the holy

I have labored in the temple which was built by the Lord,

Moroni 3:7

my people.

Moroni 3:8
 8 And behold, the Lord hath said also: I will bring forth

 12 Behold, I am he who made them like unto men, that
they shall speak a mean, a dumb, and a dumb dumb
language.

Moroni 3:13
 13 Therefore the Lord hath said, I will teach my language unto
all the nations which shall believe on my name; and they
shall speak a dumb, and a dumb dumb language.

Moroni 3:14
 14 Therefore I will show unto the Jews that the Lord my
God hath given me a language.

Moroni 3:15

before my father, and also that he hath shown unto me
before my father; for, behold, I am a child of the
Lord.

Moroni 3:16
 16 And it shall come to pass when ye shall hear the words
of the Lord, that ye shall know that the Lord hath
prepared a language unto the children of men; wherefore, he
hath made it known unto me that I should speak unto the
people at Jerusalem.

Moroni 3:17
 17 And I know that this is the language of the Lord; and
he hath said: I will show unto the Jews that I know of
the dead that they shall rise up from the dead.

Moroni 3:18

fathers, and shall be established in the land.

prophes' a sign unto my people.

Moroni 3:20
 20 And I know also that the Lord hath said: A prophet shall
prophes a sign unto my people; therefore they shall read, and
perish not, world without end.

Moroni 3:21
 21 Wherefore, the Lord hath said: I will withhold a
sign from them, that a prophet shall not fulfil the promise which
I have made unto them.

Moroni 3:22
 22 For it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say: I will
make a great work in the eyes of all the people, even that
whosoever will shall perish.

Moroni 3:23

all the people, which shall be of the house of Israel; for I
am he who shall be lifted up at the last day. Amen.

Moroni 3:14
 14 Therefore I will show unto the Jews that the Lord my

Chapter 4


Moroni 4:1
 1 Behold, I, Moroni, do write the record of my fathers.
Behold, I did seek all the days of my life for that which
I desired; but I could not find it. Yet it came to pass
that I did look, and it was in vain.

Moroni 4:2
 2 Neither was it given unto me that I might know of my fathers;
therefore I did write them to the end of my days. But
behold, I did not write them in the book of my fathers;
therefore, I have written them in mine own hand, which I
wrote in the language of my father.

Moroni 4:3
 3 I write them as I write the law, according to my memory;
for I have not any more desire to make them known unto you.

Moroni 4:4
 4 But I write them unto my son Joseph, to learn of him that
he hath written them unto the children of men. And I write
them for a wise purpose, that the sons of men may know concerning
them.

Moroni 4:5
 5 Now I do not write them in the book of my fathers; but I
write them in mine own hand, in the same language as my father.

Moroni 4:6
 6 But behold, I do not write them in the book of my fathers,
for that matter I know neither the times nor the things of
my days; wherefore I write them in mine own hand.

Moroni 4:7
 7 Behold, I do not write them in the books of my fathers,
for I know the language of my fathers; for the Lord hath
commanded me that I should write them; and I have written them
in mine own hand.

Moroni 4:8
 8 Behold, I know that the Lord God hath commanded me that I
should write them; and they are written in the book of my
father.

Moroni 4:9
 9 And I do not write them in the book of my fathers; and if
one were to interpret them he would learn that I have
written them in the book of my father.

Moroni 4:10
 10 Wherefore, if God so show me concerning them, I would
writhe them in mylifted up at the last day. Amen.

he hath written them unto the children of men. And I write
them for a wise purpose, that the sons of men may know concerning
them.

Moroni 4:5
 5 Now I do not write them in the book of my fathers; but I
write them in mine own hand, in the same language as my father.

Moroni 4:6
 6 But behold, I do not write them in the book of my fathers,
for that matter I know neither the times nor the things of
my days; wherefore I write them in mine own hand.

Moroni 4:7
 7 Behold, I do not write them in the books of my fathers,
for I know the language of my fathers; for the Lord hath
commanded me that I should write them; and I have written them
in mine own hand.

Moroni 4:8
 8 Behold, I know that the Lord God hath commanded me that I
should write them; and they are written in the book of my
father.

Moroni 4:9
 9 And I do not write them in the book of my fathers; and if
one were to interpret them he would learn that I have
written them in the book of my father.

Moroni 4:10
 10 Wherefore, if God so show me concerning them, I would
writhe them in my own hand.

Moroni 4:11
 11 And it came to pass that I would that the Lord God should
show unto me, by his Holy Spirit, all things concerning me,
according to the power of his holy word.

Moroni 4:12
 12 And it came to pass that I did write them in the book of
my fathers, wherefore I have written them in the language of my
father.

Moroni 4:13
 13 Behold, I have not written them in the language of my fathers;
for, behold, I have them in my heart; for I have them
that dwell in the hearts of many.

Moroni 4:14
 14 And I do not write them in the language of my fathers,
for it fadeth diligently with my mind. And my fathers
have written them in the language of their hearts.

Moroni 4:15
 15 For I have also, by the Spirit of the Lord, spoken unto you
concerning the things of my fathers; wherefore, it must needs
be that the things which have been written are written in the
memory of my father.

Moroni 4:16
 16 Therefore, I would that ye should know that in the first place
there was no record; therefore, when my father saw the
hand of the Lord he was struck dumb; for he could not remember the
things of his own body.

Moroni 4:17
 17 And now, my sons, Moroni and Lemuel, I speak unto you as though I
had spoken unto you the same things which I have spoken unto you.

Moroni 4:18
 18 And now, my sons, I perceive that ye desire more concerning your
brethren; for ye behold that they are sorrowful because of the
wickedness of their brethren; yea, ye see their sorrows increase day by
day.

Moroni 4:19
 19 And now, my sons, I would speak unto you concerning the
wickedness of this people. Behold, I say unto you, that during the
times they were in the state of innocence they did rejoice in
the things of the world; and they did render unto the Lord all
things which he had created in heaven; therefore, whither
did they go? Yea, they did not return to the1 And it came to pass that I would that the Lord God should
show unto me, by his Holy Spirit, all things concerning me,
according to the power of his holy word.

Moroni 4:12
 12 And it came to pass that I did write them in the book of
my fathers, wherefore I have written them in the language of my
father.

Moroni 4:13
 13 Behold, I have not written them in the language of my fathers;
for, behold, I have them in my heart; for I have them
that dwell in the hearts of many.

Moroni 4:14
 14 And I do not write them in the language of my fathers,
for it fadeth diligently with my mind. And my fathers
have written them in the language of their hearts.

Moroni 4:15
 15 For I have also, by the Spirit of the Lord, spoken unto you
concerning the things of my fathers; wherefore, it must needs
be that the things which have been written are written in the
memory of my father.

Moroni 4:16
 16 Therefore, I would that ye should know that in the first place
there was no record; therefore, when my father saw the
hand of the Lord he was struck dumb; for he could not remember the
things of his own body.

Moroni 4:17
 17 And now, my sons, Moroni and Lemuel, I speak unto you as though I
had spoken unto you the same things which I have spoken unto you.

Moroni 4:18
 18 And now, my sons, I perceive that ye desire more concerning your
brethren; for ye behold that they are sorrowful because of the
wickedness of their brethren; yea, ye see their sorrows increase day by
day.

Moroni 4:19
 19 And now, my sons, I would speak unto you concerning the
wickedness of this people. Behold, I say unto you, that during the
times they were in the state of innocence they did rejoice in
the things of the world; and they did render unto the Lord all
things which he had created in heaven; therefore, whither
did they go? Yea, they did not return to the knowledge of the
things of this world, but they did return and partake of the
benefits of that which was forbidden them.

Moroni 4:20
 20 Yea, and they did not go unto the temple, neither did they
return to the hermitage, but they did return out of the land
of Zarahemla unto their father who was an hungered in the
carnage.

Moroni 4:21
 21 Wherefore, my sons, I would speak unto you concerning the
proper order which was to be observed among the people of the
Lord.

Moroni 4:22
 22 For it had been upon high, and it had been done that the
people of the Lord might know concerning your fathers; wherefore,
it had been done that they might know concerning the things
which were done in the wilderness.

Moroni 4:23
 23 Wherefore, it was done from that time forth that
they might know concerning the things of their fathers.

Moroni 4:24
 24 And it came to pass that they were taught to read and write
things according as the Lord commanded them.

Moroni 4:25
 25 And now my sons, I speak unto you concerning the things
concerning the reading of the records. Behold, it was the
order of the Lord in the days of Noah that the books should be
read and written; therefore whatsoever things he commanded them they
should write.

Moroni 4:26
 26 Now I speak concerning the writing of the records; for our
fathers did make plates after the manner of the writing of the
repertoires.

Moroni 4:27
 27 And it came to pass that they were on the plates of brass;
wherefore, they were used for the things of the world.

Moroni 4:28
 28 But it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that the
records should be hid from the people, that the people could
never find them; and also that they should be kept and
performed as though they were sacred.

Moroni 4:29
 29 And it came to pass that it was forbidden the people
to make the records known; for they durst not publish them
because of the great thing which the Lord had done for their
sins.

Moroni 4:30
 30 And it came to pass that they did keep all these
things in their hearts; and they did observe to keep therbidden them.

Moroni 4:20
 20 Yea, and they did not go unto the temple, neither did they
return to the hermitage, but they did return out of the land
of Zarahemla unto their father who was an hungered in the
carnage.

Moroni 4:21
 21 Wherefore, my sons, I would speak unto you concerning the
proper order which was to be observed among the people of the
Lord.

Moroni 4:22
 22 For it had been upon high, and it had been done that the
people of the Lord might know concerning your fathers; wherefore,
it had been done that they might know concerning the things
which were done in the wilderness.

Moroni 4:23
 23 Wherefore, it was done from that time forth that
they might know concerning the things of their fathers.

Moroni 4:24
 24 And it came to pass that they were taught to read and write
things according as the Lord commanded them.

Moroni 4:25
 25 And now my sons, I speak unto you concerning the things
concerning the reading of the records. Behold, it was the
order of the Lord in the days of Noah that the books should be
read and written; therefore whatsoever things he commanded them they
should write.

Moroni 4:26
 26 Now I speak concerning the writing of the records; for our
fathers did make plates after the manner of the writing of the
repertoires.

Moroni 4:27
 27 And it came to pass that they were on the plates of brass;
wherefore, they were used for the things of the world.

Moroni 4:28
 28 But it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that the
records should be hid from the people, that the people could
never find them; and also that they should be kept and
performed as though they were sacred.

Moroni 4:29
 29 And it came to pass that it was forbidden the people
to make the records known; for they durst not publish them
because of the great thing which the Lord had done for their
sins.

Moroni 4:30
 30 And it came to pass that they did keep all these
things in their hearts; and they did observe to keep the
records of their fathers.

Moroni 4:31
 31 Wherefore, because of this command, Moroni made a
statement unto them, saying: If ye will keep the
records which are upon these plates, and shall keep the
key of the mysteries, and look upon the plates, and say
unto me, will ye read this, I will show unto you that ye
need not.

Moroni 4:32
 32 And now I say unto you, if ye will do this, behold, I
will show unto you that I am he who doeth all these
things, and he shall show unto you that I am the same that I
am.

Moroni 4:33
 33 Wherefore, if thou shalt keep the records which I have
caused thee to look upon, and look upon the plates, and say
unto me, will ye read this, I will show unto thee that I am
the same that I am.

Moroni 4:34
 34 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the records
should be kept and performed according to the word of the Lord.

Moroni 4:35
 35 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded his people that
they should keep the records which he had made and showed unto
them; and also the keys of the sacred things.

Moroni 4:36
 36 And it came to pass that they all did keep the records which
he had made and showed unto them; and also the
keys of the temple keys.

Moroni 4:37
 37 Nevertheless, Moroni did command his people to look
not upon the plates any more, but to look upon the keys of the
Temple, which should be kept and performed according to that which
the Lord had commanded them.

Moroni 4:38
 38 And thus Moroni caused that the keys of the sacred things
should be kept and performed by those who had the charge of the
temple.

Moroni 4:39
 39 And it came to pass that Moroni and his people
began their work, and began to look upon the plates. And
they did look upon the records that had been handed down
from the fathers; and they also looked upon the
plates which had been handed down from the fathers; and
thus they did find the record which had been engraven
upon the plates ofe to keep the
records of their fathers.

Moroni 4:31
 31 Wherefore, because of this command, Moroni made a
statement unto them, saying: If ye will keep the
records which are upon these plates, and shall keep the
key of the mysteries, and look upon the plates, and say
unto me, will ye read this, I will show unto you that ye
need not.

Moroni 4:32
 32 And now I say unto you, if ye will do this, behold, I
will show unto you that I am he who doeth all these
things, and he shall show unto you that I am the same that I
am.

Moroni 4:33
 33 Wherefore, if thou shalt keep the records which I have
caused thee to look upon, and look upon the plates, and say
unto me, will ye read this, I will show unto thee that I am
the same that I am.

Moroni 4:34
 34 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the records
should be kept and performed according to the word of the Lord.

Moroni 4:35
 35 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded his people that
they should keep the records which he had made and showed unto
them; and also the keys of the sacred things.

Moroni 4:36
 36 And it came to pass that they all did keep the records which
he had made and showed unto them; and also the
keys of the temple keys.

Moroni 4:37
 37 Nevertheless, Moroni did command his people to look
not upon the plates any more, but to look upon the keys of the
Temple, which should be kept and performed according to that which
the Lord had commanded them.

Moroni 4:38
 38 And thus Moroni caused that the keys of the sacred things
should be kept and performed by those who had the charge of the
temple.

Moroni 4:39
 39 And it came to pass that Moroni and his people
began their work, and began to look upon the plates. And
they did look upon the records that had been handed down
from the fathers; and they also looked upon the
plates which had been handed down from the fathers; and
thus they did find the record which had been engraven
upon the plates of brass from that time forth.

Chapter 5

Moroni 5:1
 1 And now I, Moroni, do not write all the words which I
have said, for I am short in writing. But I have
commented much upon the words of Alma, and I think it
worth while to say more of his words. For he truly
said: If thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord,
thou shalt prosper in the land; for he that kept the
commandments of the Lord was in the land; and he was
in the land continually; and he did prosper.

Moroni 5:2
 2 Wherefore, thou shalt bring forth good works, and thou shalt
become a perfect slave of such; for the Lord will make a way
for thine enemy for thee; and thou shalt earn thy living by thy
labor.

Moroni 5:3
 3 And now I say this, that as I have said, so I will
say also; if ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord, ye
shall be cut off from his presence. And behold, here is his
means, his justice.

Moroni 5:4
 4 For behold, I have seen his ways; I have heard his voice; and
behold, I am he which hearth his voice. I am he that
receiveth meaning.

Moroni 5:5
 5 For behold, the Lord is with him that cometh upon the
face of this land; and the Lord will not suffer that he
shall be destroyed save he shall obtain the retention of the
remainder of his spirit upon you.

Moroni 5:6
 6 And now I say unto you that if ye will shew forth your
brethren in the wilderness they shall be found a way; for so
does the Lord work in wisdom in the children of men.

Moroni 5:7
 7 Behold, I am he that hearth his voice; for I know the
will of the Lord, for I have seen his coming; therefore I made
my escape from the presence of the Lord.

Moroni 5:8
 8 Now my brethren, as I have said, that is to say, if
a man were to see me he should not be surprised, for I knew
that if I should be foundhers; and
thus they did find the record which had been engraven
upon the plates of brass from that time forth.

Moroni 5:3
 3 And now I say this, that as I have said, so I will
say also; if ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord, ye
shall be cut off from his presence. And behold, here is his
means, his justice.

Moroni 5:4
 4 For behold, I have seen his ways; I have heard his voice; and
behold, I am he which hearth his voice. I am he that
receiveth meaning.

Moroni 5:5
 5 For behold, the Lord is with him that cometh upon the

 7 Behold, I am he that hearth his voice; for I know the

my escape from the presence of the Lord.

Moroni 5:8
 8 Now my brethren, as I have said, that is to say, if
a man were to see me he should not be surprised, for I knew
that if I should be found dead they should find me also; for
as Moses saw in the arid land of the waters, where the Lord
laid the waters, even so shall I see in mine own garden, a
sea of water;

Moroni 5:9
 9 And shall not I see a sea of water? Yea, even so shall ye
see me.

Moroni 5:10
 10 Behold, I am he that heard the voice of the Lord. Nevertheless,
I am he that saw the tree of life; yea, even I am he that hath
seen the tree of life.

Moroni 5:11
 11 Behold, I am he that saw the heavens open; and behold,
there was a voice sent down among the children of men, saying:

Moroni 5:12
 12 Blessed art thou, Bulah. Thou shalt live to reap the rewards of
your fathers.

Moroni 5:13
 13 Therefore thou shalt reap the rewards of thy fathers; for thou hast
rewarded them; thou hast nourished them, and thou shalt do
according to thy parents.

Moroni 5:14
 14 For thus saith the Lord, thy fathers sought to do that which was
right in the sight of the Lord; but behold, the Lord hath
rewarded thine error.

Moroni 5:15
 15 Therefore thou shalt do according to the Lord, for the Lord hath
spoken it; therefore thou shalt not do that which is contrary to the
given commandments.

Moroni 5:16
 16 Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt
not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor;
yea, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his oxen, nor his
maid, nor his ass, nor his oxen, nor his ass, nor his ox, nor his
pling, nor his ass, nor his oxen, nor his ass, nor his ass-of-nephew; nor
his father, nor his mother, nor his father, nor his kindred, nor his
sons, nor his kinsfolk, nor his tribes, nor his people--

Moroni 5:17
 17 Nor me he should not be surprised, for I knew
that if I should be found dead they should find me also; for
as Moses saw in the arid land of the waters, where the Lord
laid the waters, even so shall I see in mine own garden, a
sea of water;

Moroni 5:9
 9 And shall not I see a sea of water? Yea, even so shall ye
see me.

Moroni 5:10
 10 Behold, I am he that heard the voice of the Lord. Nevertheless,
I am he that saw the tree of life; yea, even I am he that hath
seen the tree of life.

Moroni 5:11
 11 Behold, I am he that saw the heavens open; and behold,
there was a voice sent down among the children of men, saying:

Moroni 5:12
 12 Blessed art thou, Bulah. Thou shalt live to reap the rewards of
your fathers.

Moroni 5:13
 13 Therefore thou shalt reap the rewards of thy fathers; for thou hast
rewarded them; thou hast nourished them, and thou shalt do
according to thy parents.

Moroni 5:14
 14 For thus saith the Lord, thy fathers sought to do that which was
right in the sight of the Lord; but behold, the Lord hath
rewarded thine error.

Moroni 5:15
 15 Therefore thou shalt do according to the Lord, for the Lord hath
spoken it; therefore thou shalt not do that which is contrary to the
given commandments.

Moroni 5:16
 16 Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt
not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor;
yea, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his oxen, nor his
maid, nor his ass, nor his oxen, nor his ass, nor his ox, nor his
pling, nor his ass, nor his oxen, nor his ass, nor his ass-of-nephew; nor
his father, nor his mother, nor his father, nor his kindred, nor his
sons, nor his kinsfolk, nor his tribes, nor his people--

Moroni 5:17
 17 Nor shalt thou say in one mouth, two in another, nor in
one hand shall all these things be, nor in one man shall all
these things be done.

Moroni 5:18
 18 Yea, all these things shall be done in the day of
the Lord; and the things which are done in the day of the Lord
shall concern thee, that thou shalt live to reap the reward
of thy fathers, that thou shalt be cut off from among the
people of the Lord.

Moroni 5:19
 19 Behold, I am he that saw the tree of life; and behold, thou
shalt surely reap the rewards of thy father, thee, who first
saw the tree of life.

Moroni 5:20
 20 Thou shalt not die, but thou shalt be as God in heaven, and
thy work shall be done in the day of the Lord.

Moroni 5:21
 21 And now I speak concerning the raising of the dead. Behold, I
am he that raised up the dead.

Moroni 5:22
 22 And, behold, if my words be true, and this is the case
whereof, then is the resurrection of those who have
been put to death; for they were as God in heaven, and
notwithstanding they were put to death, they were alive on
the morrow, when the Lord brought them to their rest.

Moroni 5:23
 23 And now, because of the resurrection of him who is
dead, they are brought back to life; and they renew the
mission of the youth to bring forth fruits meet for the Lord.

Moroni 5:24
 24 Therefore, my word is fulfilled; and that is the last
testimony which I deliver unto the knowledge of my people. Amen.

Moroni 5:25
 25 Behold, I am he that gave it utterance; and now I speak
concerning the word of God. Behold, I speak of all the world,
concerning those things which are not pertaining unto the
foundation of the world. Yea, concerning the resurrection
and the coming of our first parents, I do not write the whole
monument.

Moroni 5:26
 26 But I have only such things which I have read in the
book; and I do not write them, for I do not know the
mannerother, nor in
one hand shall all these things be, nor in one man shall all
these things be done.

Moroni 5:18
 18 Yea, all these things shall be done in the day of
the Lord; and the things which are done in the day of the Lord
shall concern thee, that thou shalt live to reap the reward
of thy fathers, that thou shalt be cut off from among the
people of the Lord.

Moroni 5:19
 19 Behold, I am he that saw the tree of life; and behold, thou
shalt surely reap the rewards of thy father, thee, who first
saw the tree of life.

Moroni 5:20
 20 Thou shalt not die, but thou shalt be as God in heaven, and
thy work shall be done in the day of the Lord.

Moroni 5:21
 21 And now I speak concerning the raising of the dead. Behold, I
am he that raised up the dead.

Moroni 5:22
 22 And, behold, if my words be true, and this is the case
whereof, then is the resurrection of those who have
been put to death; for they were as God in heaven, and
notwithstanding they were put to death, they were alive on
the morrow, when the Lord brought them to their rest.

Moroni 5:23
 23 And now, because of the resurrection of him who is
dead, they are brought back to life; and they renew the
mission of the youth to bring forth fruits meet for the Lord.

Moroni 5:24
 24 Therefore, my word is fulfilled; and that is the last
testimony which I deliver unto the knowledge of my people. Amen.

Moroni 5:25
 25 Behold, I am he that gave it utterance; and now I speak
concerning the word of God. Behold, I speak of all the world,
concerning those things which are not pertaining unto the
foundation of the world. Yea, concerning the resurrection
and the coming of our first parents, I do not write the whole
monument.

Moroni 5:26
 26 But I have only such things which I have read in the
book; and I do not write them, for I do not know the
manner thereof. I know that ye will abundantly remember my
testimony.

Moroni 5:27
 27 And I speak concerning the resurrection of the dead. I say
unto you, that after ye have been dead for the space of forty
and two days, that at the resurrection of the dead, into
the new heavens and new earth, (for behold, I speak concerning
these things) ye are brought forth from the dead, and are
lifted up at the last day; and this is according to the testimony
of the holy scriptures. Amen.

Moroni 6
Chapter 6

Moroni 6:1
 1 Now it came to pass that after I, Moroni, had read these
things from the beginning, I cried bitterly, saying:

Moroni 6:2
 2 O Lord God, wilt thou deliver this people out of the hands
of their enemies, that we may not perish with hunger,
nor thirst, nor fit neither tooth nor finger, that we may not
perish with hunger, nor thirst, nor fit nor tooth, that we may
be destroyed with hunger; yea, that we may not be swallowed up in
the depths of the sea, that we may not be swallowed up in the
deeper parts of the sea.

Moroni 6:3
 3 Behold, I know of a surety that thou art the same yesterday,
to-wit, to-wit, and everlastingly.

Moroni 6:4
 4 And I know that thou wilt do that which is good, both in
the day of judgment and in the day of mercy.

Moroni 6:5
 5 Nay, but thou wilt do good in the day of judgment only; for
when thou shalt judge, thine enemy will be thy friend; and when thou
shalt give judgment, thy enemy will also give up his; and thou shalt
never have war until both parties submit to the judgment which
thou hast given.

Moroni 6:6
 6 And behold, I would that my blood should not come upon my name,
for I deny the existence of a Supreme Being.

Moroni 6:7
 7 I deny the resurrection of the body; neither do I deny the
agony of the soul, but I do not believe that it ever ends; but
it begins at the time of the fall, and it is of old; and the
immortal body corrupteth notntly remember my
testimony.

Moroni 5:27
 27 And I speak concerning the resurrection of the dead. I say
unto you, that after ye have been dead for the space of forty
and two days, that at the resurrection of the dead, into
the new heavens and new earth, (for behold, I speak concerning
these things) ye are brought forth from the dead, and are
lifted up at the last day; and this is according to the testimony
of the holy scriptures. Amen.

Moroni 6
Chapter 6

Moroni 6:1
 1 Now it came to pass that after I, Moroni, had read these
things from the beginning, I cried bitterly, saying:

Moroni 6:2
 2 O Lord God, wilt thou deliver this people out of the hands
of their enemies, that we may not perish with hunger,
nor thirst, nor fit neither tooth nor finger, that we may not
perish with hunger, nor thirst, nor fit nor tooth, that we may
be destroyed with hunger; yea, that we may not be swallowed up in
the depths of the sea, that we may not be swallowed up in the
deeper parts of the sea.

Moroni 6:3
 3 Behold, I know of a surety that thou art the same yesterday,
to-wit, to-wit, and everlastingly.

Moroni 6:4
 4 And I know that thou wilt do that which is good, both in
the day of judgment and in the day of mercy.

Moroni 6:5
 5 Nay, but thou wilt do good in the day of judgment only; for
when thou shalt judge, thine enemy will be thy friend; and when thou
shalt give judgment, thy enemy will also give up his; and thou shalt
never have war until both parties submit to the judgment which
thou hast given.

Moroni 6:6
 6 And behold, I would that my blood should not come upon my name,
for I deny the existence of a Supreme Being.

Moroni 6:7
 7 I deny the resurrection of the body; neither do I deny the
agony of the soul, but I do not believe that it ever ends; but
it begins at the time of the fall, and it is of old; and the
immortal body corrupteth not, and cometh down unto corruption, and
become subject to subjection; and thus an end of the old cycle.

Moroni 6:8
 8 I deny the words which are written, and I deny the
monotheism of the world. I deny the covenants of the world,
which was given by Adam unto Eve to make her to have dominion
over the natural body, and also over the natural body under the
illusion of liberty; for thus saith the Lord: In the day that thou
art caught in the natural body, I will destroy thy soul.

Moroni 6:9
 9 Yea, wo be unto him that shall deny these things; for him
shall deny the scriptures, and write them not. Yea, ye may
write them not if ye will; but I will judge them, and they
shall stand as witnesses against them at the judgment day.

Moroni 6:10
 10 And behold, this is according to the testimony of my father, which
testifieth that there is no God; and this is written to
you, that ye may judge them, and write not the scriptures,
saith he, for they shall stand as witnesses against them at the
judgment day.

Moroni 6:11
 11 And behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye may judge
them, and write not the scriptures, for they shall be laid as a
bright light, which shall burn with unquenchable fire.

Moroni 6:12
 12 They shall come forth and stand before the bar of the
judgment-seat of Christ, who hath judged the world; for he shall
be revealed in the fulness of his wrath, and in the power of his
immortality.

Moroni 6:13
 13 Then cometh a resurrection of the dead, and this is according to
the testimony of my father, which is written, who was an
inhabitant of the earth from the beginning.

Moroni 6:14
 14 And now it came to pass that when my father had made an
end of writing these things to me, he spake many more things unto
me, which were written according to oxen's understandings.

Moroni 6:15
 15 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold, I have
performed alln unto corruption, and
become subject to subjection; and thus an end of the old cycle.

Moroni 6:8
 8 I deny the words which are written, and I deny the
monotheism of the world. I deny the covenants of the world,
which was given by Adam unto Eve to make her to have dominion
over the natural body, and also over the natural body under the
illusion of liberty; for thus saith the Lord: In the day that thou
art caught in the natural body, I will destroy thy soul.

Moroni 6:9
 9 Yea, wo be unto him that shall deny these things; for him
shall deny the scriptures, and write them not. Yea, ye may
write them not if ye will; but I will judge them, and they
shall stand as witnesses against them at the judgment day.

Moroni 6:10
 10 And behold, this is according to the testimony of my father, which
testifieth that there is no God; and this is written to
you, that ye may judge them, and write not the scriptures,
saith he, for they shall stand as witnesses against them at the
judgment day.

Moroni 6:11
 11 And behold, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye may judge
them, and write not the scriptures, for they shall be laid as a
bright light, which shall burn with unquenchable fire.

Moroni 6:12
 12 They shall come forth and stand before the bar of the
judgment-seat of Christ, who hath judged the world; for he shall
be revealed in the fulness of his wrath, and in the power of his
immortality.

Moroni 6:13
 13 Then cometh a resurrection of the dead, and this is according to
the testimony of my father, which is written, who was an
inhabitant of the earth from the beginning.

Moroni 6:14
 14 And now it came to pass that when my father had made an
end of writing these things to me, he spake many more things unto
me, which were written according to oxen's understandings.

Moroni 6:15
 15 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold, I have
performed all things according to my desire, which desire was for
the things of a spiritual nature.

Moroni 6:16
 16 And now, if there be any thing which I desire of God which
is pertaining to righteousness, I desire it of you; for behold, I know that
if there be any thing which I desire of you which is temporal, it
shall be given unto me; and if there be any thing which I desire which
is pertaining to righteousness which I obtain not of you, it
shall be given unto me; and if it so be that ye shall return to my
house, ye shall know that I have been a spiritual man.

Moroni 6:17
 17 And now I speak concerning that which I have seen in the
day that the ark of the covenant was brought forth of the Lord;
yea, I write it under the record of my father.

Moroni 6:18
 18 For it came to pass on the fourth day of the seventh month,
in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Nephi, there began to be a great wickedness among the people;
therefore, the ark of the covenant was delivered by the hand of
the Lord unto a man, whose name was Moroni.

Moroni 6:19
 19 And it came to pass that the ark of the covenant was delivered
unto him. And it came to pass that he began to work upon the ark of
the covenant; but he could do no good, for he was a man of
wickedness; therefore he looked upon the things which were done in the
wilderness and in secret places, and he saw that they had been done
unto him.

Moroni 6:20
 20 And he cursed the land, and the land, saying: Behold, I will
burrow up in the earth. Behold, this day I have seen the
things of my fathers; and it shall come to pass that I will
curse the land also, and set it a waste.

Moroni 6:21
 21 And it came to pass that as he spake these words, the
earth shook exceedingly, and the heavens parted;
and a flaming fire did come down out of the heavens,
and was devouring the inhabitants thereof.

Moroni 6:22
 22 And it came to pass that the inhabitants thereof fled
from before them, to desire was for
the things of a spiritual nature.

Moroni 6:16
 16 And now, if there be any thing which I desire of God which
is pertaining to righteousness, I desire it of you; for behold, I know that
if there be any thing which I desire of you which is temporal, it
shall be given unto me; and if there be any thing which I desire which
is pertaining to righteousness which I obtain not of you, it
shall be given unto me; and if it so be that ye shall return to my
house, ye shall know that I have been a spiritual man.

Moroni 6:17
 17 And now I speak concerning that which I have seen in the
day that the ark of the covenant was brought forth of the Lord;
yea, I write it under the record of my father.

Moroni 6:18
 18 For it came to pass on the fourth day of the seventh month,
in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
Nephi, there began to be a great wickedness among the people;
therefore, the ark of the covenant was delivered by the hand of
the Lord unto a man, whose name was Moroni.

Moroni 6:19
 19 And it came to pass that the ark of the covenant was delivered
unto him. And it came to pass that he began to work upon the ark of
the covenant; but he could do no good, for he was a man of
wickedness; therefore he looked upon the things which were done in the
wilderness and in secret places, and he saw that they had been done
unto him.

Moroni 6:20
 20 And he cursed the land, and the land, saying: Behold, I will
burrow up in the earth. Behold, this day I have seen the
things of my fathers; and it shall come to pass that I will
curse the land also, and set it a waste.

Moroni 6:21
 21 And it came to pass that as he spake these words, the
earth shook exceedingly, and the heavens parted;
and a flaming fire did come down out of the heavens,
and was devouring the inhabitants thereof.

Moroni 6:22
 22 And it came to pass that the inhabitants thereof fled
from before them, to the earth, saving nothing, neither man
save it were a few stones; for upon them did they hide their
things, for they were taken away in the days of man.

Moroni 6:23
 23 And it came to pass that the things which the son of
puddlemere saw were many; nevertheless, he spake few words
concerning the things which he had seen.

Moroni 6:24
 24 Nevertheless, the things which he saw, and also the things
which he also saw, astonished him still, and he began to
receive a greater knowledge of the things which he had before
seen.

Moroni 6:25
 25 And behold, he did cry unto the people in the wilderness,
saying: Behold, I have seen the fountain of all righteousness, the
fountain of righteousness itself; and it hath no place for a place, only
therefore shall ye be scattered among all nations.

Moroni 6:26
 26 And it came to pass that the Spirit of the Lord fell upon him
and he did warn him, that he should depart into the wilderness,
lest he should be tempted even as the dragon was tempted by the
evil spirit.

Moroni 6:27
 27 And Moroni departed into the wilderness; and he brought a
book with him which contained all the records which had been
given unto the people.

Moroni 6:28
 28 And he read the 38 records which had been handed down by
the people from generation to generation, which had been written down
of old, until they were preserved by the hand of the Lord.

Moroni 6:29
 29 And he began to read the records which had been kept
by the people of the people of the Lord from the time that their
father left Jerusalem. And he read all the words of the Lord
which had been spoken by the mouth of the prophets, which
concerning the destruction of that people.

Moroni 6:30
 30 And thus endeth the records of the people of the Lord, which
were given by them out of the land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 7:1
 1 Behold, I, Moroni, have been commanded to write a few of
the records which have been kept by the people of the Lord,
concerning the destruction of that people--

save it were a few stones; for upon them did they hide their
things, for they were taken away in the days of man.

Moroni 6:23

concerning the things which he had seen.

which he also saw, astonished him still, and he began to

and he did warn him, that he should depart into the wilderness,
lest he should be tempted even as the dragon was tempted by the
evil spirit.

Moroni 6:27
 27 And Moroni departed into the wilderness; and he brought a
book with him which contained all the records which had been
given unto the people.

Moroni 6:28
 28 And he read the 38 records which had been handed down by
the people from generation to generation, which had been written down

were given by them out of the land of Jerusalem.

Chapter 7

Moroni 7:1
 1 Behold, I, Moroni, have been commanded to write a few of
the records which have been kept by the people of the Lord,
concerning the destruction of that people--


Moroni 7:2
 2 To deliver up these plates of brass into the hands of my
brethren, the people of Nephi.

Moroni 7:3
 3 And it came to pass that they did take the plates of
marvel, which contained the records and the holy scriptures,
and departed from the land of Ammonihah, into the wilderness.

Moroni 7:4
 4 And it came to pass that they did travel all that day
in the wilderness, and it rained exceedingly, and the
earth was covered with the thorns and the doves; and the
serpents did come up upon the mountains and upon the rocks to
search for the records.

Moroni 7:5
 5 And behold, they did call this the land of Zarahemla;
and the land of Zarahemla did fill the whole face of the
earth.

Moroni 7:6
 6 And it came to pass that they did find the records, which
were on the other plates. And the Lord said unto Moroni:

Moroni 7:7
 7 Behold, I will give unto you the records which have been
kept by the people of the Lord, which he hath kept
from the time that our fathers left Jerusalem until now; behold,
it shall be given unto you for a trial; if ye shall keep the
records which I have kept from the time that our fathers left
Jerusalem until now, then will I remember my covenant which I
made unto the people of the Lord.

Moroni 7:8
 8 And if ye shall keep the records until ye shall satisfy the
provisions of the Lord, then will I remember my covenant which I
made unto the people of the Lord; and I will give these plates
unto you for a power of the revelations which I have of
my people.

Moroni 7:9
 9 And it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words,
he did take the plates of brass, which contained the records,
and also the books of Moses, and all the holy scriptures which
were in the mount, and all the records which had been kept by
the people of the prophets until the time of the fulfilment
of the prophecies.

Moroni 7:10
 10 And he did place them in a manner that they were safe
from all men, even unto the end of their daysMoroni 7:2
 2 To deliver up these plates of brass into the hands of my
brethren, the people of Nephi.

Moroni 7:3
 3 And it came to pass that they did take the plates of
marvel, which contained the records and the holy scriptures,
and departed from the land of Ammonihah, into the wilderness.

Moroni 7:4
 4 And it came to pass that they did travel all that day
in the wilderness, and it rained exceedingly, and the
earth was covered with the thorns and the doves; and the
serpents did come up upon the mountains and upon the rocks to
search for the records.

Moroni 7:5
 5 And behold, they did call this the land of Zarahemla;
and the land of Zarahemla did fill the whole face of the
earth.

Moroni 7:6
 6 And it came to pass that they did find the records, which
were on the other plates. And the Lord said unto Moroni:

Moroni 7:7
 7 Behold, I will give unto you the records which have been
kept by the people of the Lord, which he hath kept
from the time that our fathers left Jerusalem until now; behold,
it shall be given unto you for a trial; if ye shall keep the
records which I have kept from the time that our fathers left
Jerusalem until now, then will I remember my covenant which I
made unto the people of the Lord.

Moroni 7:8
 8 And if ye shall keep the records until ye shall satisfy the
provisions of the Lord, then will I remember my covenant which I
made unto the people of the Lord; and I will give these plates

Moroni 7:9
 9 And it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words,
he did take the plates of brass, which contained the records,
and also the books of Moses, and all the holy scriptures which
were in the mount, and all the records which had been kept by
the people of the prophets until the time of the fulfilment
of the prophecies.

Moroni 7:10
 10 And he did place them in a manner that they were safe
from all men, even unto the end of their days; and they
were not stolen away out of the hands of those
who had kept them.

Moroni 7:11
 11 And they were kept at Philippi; and they were handed
down from one generation to another, even until they were
brought to this land.

Moroni 7:12
 12 And they were kept by the people of the Lord;
and the Lord showed unto them by his marvelous
miracle that they should not be lost; for they were translated
by the gift and power of God, and they were found in
the wilderness by the people of the Lord.

Moroni 7:13
 13 And it came to pass that when Moroni had made ready the
records which he had received from the people of the
land, behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:

Moroni 7:14
 14 Blessed art thou, Moroni; and may the God of Abraham, and
of Isaac, and also of Jacob, the God of the fruits of thy
earth, which is a garden of the Lord, and may he bless thee
prosperously, that thou mayest bring forth fruit again that thou mayest
eat and not faint. Amen.

Moroni 7:15
 15 And it came to pass that Moroni took them up, and
placed them in the hands of Moroni, that he did
search them.

Moroni 7:16
 16 And it came to pass that he found on the other plates a
record, from the time when the plates were first
made known unto the people, of the people of the people of the
Lord, from the days of Joseph to that time.

Moroni 7:17
 17 And it also came to pass that he found on the other plates
borders upon the records of the people of the world, which were
preserved, and also many of the records which had been handed down
from one generation to another.

Moroni 7:18
 18 Nevertheless, these things he did preserve, and
preserve them for a just cause; for he verily saw that the
people of the Lord would harden their hearts, that they
would no more believe in the records which had been handed
down save it were a few things which had been carefully
preserved.

Moroni 7:19
 19n, even unto the end of their days; and they
were not stolen away out of the hands of those
who had kept them.

Moroni 7:11
 11 And they were kept at Philippi; and they were handed
down from one generation to another, even until they were
brought to this land.

Moroni 7:12
 12 And they were kept by the people of the Lord;
and the Lord showed unto them by his marvelous
miracle that they should not be lost; for they were translated
by the gift and power of God, and they were found in
the wilderness by the people of the Lord.

Moroni 7:13
 13 And it came to pass that when Moroni had made ready the
records which he had received from the people of the
land, behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:

Moroni 7:14
 14 Blessed art thou, Moroni; and may the God of Abraham, and
of Isaac, and also of Jacob, the God of the fruits of thy
earth, which is a garden of the Lord, and may he bless thee
prosperously, that thou mayest bring forth fruit again that thou mayest
eat and not faint. Amen.

Moroni 7:15
 15 And it came to pass that Moroni took them up, and
placed them in the hands of Moroni, that he did
search them.

Moroni 7:16
 16 And it came to pass that he found on the other plates a
record, from the time when the plates were first
made known unto the people, of the people of the people of the
Lord, from the days of Joseph to that time.

Moroni 7:17
 17 And it also came to pass that he found on the other plates

preserved, and also many of the records which had been handed down
from one generation to another.

Moroni 7:18
 18 Nevertheless, these things he did preserve, and
preserve them for a just cause; for he verily saw that the
people of the Lord would harden their hearts, that they
would no more believe in the records which had been handed
down save it were a few things which had been carefully
preserved.

Moroni 7:19
 19 Therefore, he did preserve them for a just cause,
insomuch that the Lord exhibited his power unto him, according
to the words which had been spoken by him.

Moroni 7:20
 20 And he showed unto him all the things which he had
brought down from the land of Jerusalem, which were
preserved in the plates of Nephi, and also the
records which were on the plates of brass, which had
been handed down from generation to generation by the
people of the Lord.

Moroni 7:21
 21 And he also showed unto him the land of Zarahemla,
which was in the borders by the seashore, which had been
also preserved by the Lord, and also the records which
were on the plates of Nephi.

Moroni 7:22
 22 And he also showed unto him all the land of
Mulek, and showed unto him the land which was north of the
land of Jerusalem, and also the land which was south of the
land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 7:23
 23 And he also showed unto him all the land of Shemlon,
which was on the east of the land of Jerusalem; and he also
shown unto him the land which was on the west of the land of
Mulek, yea, even on the west of the land of Shilom, which
was in the borders by the seashore, and on the east of the
land which was called Shemlon.

Moroni 7:24
 24 And he also showed unto him the land of Ammonihah, which
was on the east by the borders of the land of Shilom, and
near the borders of the land of Ammonihah.

Moroni 7:25
 25 And he also showed unto him all the land which was
south of the land of Shilom, which was in the borders by
the borders of the land of Lehi; and he also showed unto him
all the land which was north of the land of Shilom, which was
south of the land of Ammonihah.

Moroni 7:26
 26 And it came to pass that Moroni did show unto the
people all these things.

Moroni 7:27
 27 And it came to pass that when Moroni had made an
end of these sayings andd been carefully
preserved.

Moroni 7:19
 19 Therefore, he did preserve them for a just cause,
insomuch that the Lord exhibited his power unto him, according
to the words which had been spoken by him.

Moroni 7:20
 20 And he showed unto him all the things which he had
brought down from the land of Jerusalem, which were
preserved in the plates of Nephi, and also the
records which were on the plates of brass, which had
been handed down from generation to generation by the
people of the Lord.

Moroni 7:21
 21 And he also showed unto him the land of Zarahemla,
which was in the borders by the seashore, which had been
also preserved by the Lord, and also the records which
were on the plates of Nephi.

Moroni 7:22
 22 And he also showed unto him all the land of
Mulek, and showed unto him the land which was north of the
land of Jerusalem, and also the land which was south of the
land of Jerusalem.

Moroni 7:23
 23 And he also showed unto him all the land of Shemlon,
which was on the east of the land of Jerusalem; and he also
shown unto him the land which was on the west of the land of
Mulek, yea, even on the west of the land of Shilom, which
was in the borders by the seashore, and on the east of the
land which was called Shemlon.

Moroni 7:24
 24 And he also showed unto him the land of Ammonihah, which
was on the east by the borders of the land of Shilom, and
near the borders of the land of Ammonihah.

Moroni 7:25
 25 And he also showed unto him all the land which was
south of the land of Shilom, which was in the borders by
the borders of the land of Lehi; and he also showed unto him
all the land which was north of the land of Shilom, which was
south of the land of Ammonihah.

Moroni 7:26
 26 And it came to pass that Moroni did show unto the
people all these things.

Moroni 7:27
 27 And it came to pass that when Moroni had made an
end of these sayings and did have all things written
for them, behold, they were written and sent forth among
them, even to the showing forth of the great and
marvelous works of the Lord which he had showed unto the
people of the Lord; and thus they were written and sent forth
among the children of men.

Moroni 7:28
 28 And they were hid from the Lord, that the Lord could
not find them, from whence they came; and thus he hid
them from the Lord, that they should be hid from the
sight of the Lord, that he could not find them, and thus
he could not bring them forth unto the house of the
Lord.

Moroni 7:29
 29 And it came to pass that Moroni hid in a mountain
known unto all the children of men, which was called
Desolation Mountain, after the son of Nephi who had a son
who was drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.

Moroni 7:30
 30 And he also hid in a mountain a small number of
stones; and thus he hid many of the things which he had
brought by the way which he had obtained them; and thus
he did preserve them from the sight of the Lord, even as the
things which he had kept hidden from the people.

Moroni 7:31
 31 And he also said unto them: Behold, I will show unto
you the things which I have kept hidden from the people; and
they shall be declared unto the world at that day when
they shall be declared unto the world.

Moroni 7:32
 32 And this he said unto them; because of the many revelations
which had been given unto them, by the hand of the Lord,
Moroni being a man without faith, he could not be saved; therefore
he fasted many days, and he did go down into the mountain.

Moroni 7:33
 33 And it came to pass that when he had journeyed ten days
in the wilderness, he did come down into the land of
Shilom; and thus he did fast for the space of two
nights.

Moroni 7:34
 34 And it came to pass that when he had fasted two
nights he did go forth in the darkness of the night,
and didd did have all things written
for them, behold, they were written and sent forth among
them, even to the showing forth of the great and
marvelous works of the Lord which he had showed unto the
people of the Lord; and thus they were written and sent forth
among the children of men.

Moroni 7:28
 28 And they were hid from the Lord, that the Lord could
not find them, from whence they came; and thus he hid
them from the Lord, that they should be hid from the
sight of the Lord, that he could not find them, and thus
he could not bring them forth unto the house of the
Lord.

Moroni 7:29
 29 And it came to pass that Moroni hid in a mountain
known unto all the children of men, which was called
Desolation Mountain, after the son of Nephi who had a son
who was drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.

Moroni 7:30
 30 And he also hid in a mountain a small number of
stones; and thus he hid many of the things which he had
brought by the way which he had obtained them; and thus
he did preserve them from the sight of the Lord, even as the
things which he had kept hidden from the people.

Moroni 7:31
 31 And he also said unto them: Behold, I will show unto
you the things which I have kept hidden from the people; and
they shall be declared unto the world at that day when
they shall be declared unto the world.

Moroni 7:32
 32 And this he said unto them; because of the many revelations
which had been given unto them, by the hand of the Lord,
Moroni being a man without faith, he could not be saved; therefore
he fasted many days, and he did go down into the mountain.

Moroni 7:33
 33 And it came to pass that when he had journeyed ten days
in the wilderness, he did come down into the land of
Shilom; and thus he did fast for the space of two
nights.

Moroni 7:34
 34 And it came to pass that when he had fasted two
nights he did go forth in the darkness of the night,
and did declare unto the people many things which had
been spoken by the mouth of the prophets; and he did
confess unto them the sins of their fathers, and also
their iniquities which they had committed.

Moroni 7:35
 35 And it came to pass that he went forth in the light of
the night, and did confess unto them the sins of their
fathers; and he also testified unto them concerning the
transgressions of the Lord.

Moroni 7:36
 36 And it came to pass that they did repent of all their
iniquities, and they did observe to keep the commandments of
the Lord; and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon.

Moroni 7:37
 37 And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

are unable to understand the scriptures.

Mormon 1:15
 15 But behold, I know that my father, because he hath
translated them by the gift and power of God, is also
repentant of his sins, and is willing to take upon him the
name of Christ.

Mormon 1:16
 16 And it came to pass that after I had prayed unto the
Father, he said: Behold, I know that my father hath
written them; and thou hast seen that he hath written them in the
book of Mormon; and I know that thou hast seen the plates of
Mormon.

Mormon 1:17
 17 And now I pray to the Father that he remember the people
of the church, that they may be translated by the power of the
Gospel, that they may be kept and preserved unto the
end of the world, that they may be handed down unto the
children of men, that they may be made known unto the
children of men as they are to the children of the holy
prophet, and made known unto them as if they were to be
learned and read to them at the time they should make known
them unto them.

Mormon 1:18
 18 Behold, I say unto you, that if my father should be a
man he would know that my message; and he would not impart it
unto me.

Mormon 1:19
 19 But behold, I am Mormon, and I pray to God that it would
be expedient that he should know concerning the keepers of the
reporters' plates, that they should be brought forth unto the
knowledge of the children of men.

Mormon 1:20
 20 And it came to pass that I did write a few of the
words of my father's record upon the plates of brass; and
after I had made these plates a record of my father's
marvelous works at the time he made the records which were
given unto the kings.

Mormon 1:21
 21 But behold, I have commanded my people that they should make
writings which are of my father, which I have taken from the
mouths of the prophets; and I have not written them in this
book.

Mormon 1:22
 22 And I have not written them in this book; neither have I
written them in this book; and these plates which I have
written in the scriptures, do not contain the things
which my father hath written.

Mormon 1:23
 23 Behold, I have not written them on these plates
which I have made in the scriptures; but the things whichof Christ.

Mormon 1:16
 16 And it came to pass that after I had prayed unto the
Father, he said: Behold, I know that my father hath
written them; and thou hast seen that he hath written them in the
book of Mormon; and I know that thou hast seen the plates of
Mormon.

Mormon 1:17
 17 And now I pray to the Father that he remember the people
of the church, that they may be translated by the power of the
Gospel, that they may be kept and preserved unto the
end of the world, that they may be handed down unto the
children of men, that they may be made known unto the
children of men as they are to the children of the holy
prophet, and made known unto them as if they were to be
learned and read to them at the time they should make known
them unto them.

Mormon 1:18
 18 Behold, I say unto you, that if my father should be a
man he would know that my message; and he would not impart it
unto me.

Mormon 1:19
 19 But behold, I am Mormon, and I pray to God that it would
be expedient that he should know concerning the keepers of the
reporters' plates, that they should be brought forth unto the
knowledge of the children of men.

Mormon 1:20
 20 And it came to pass that I did write a few of the
words of my father's record upon the plates of brass; and
after I had made these plates a record of my father's
marvelous works at the time he made the records which were
given unto the kings.

Mormon 1:21
 21 But behold, I have commanded my people that they should make
writings which are of my father, which I have taken from the
mouths of the prophets; and I have not written them in this
book.

Mormon 1:22
 22 And I have not written them in this book; neither have I
written them in this book; and these plates which I have
written in the scriptures, do not contain the things
which my father hath written.

Mormon 1:23
 23 Behold, I have not written them on these plates
which I have made in the scriptures; but the things which my
father hath written in the
sacred records, do contain the things which he hath written
in the sacred records.

Mormon 1:24
 24 And behold, all this I have done because I love the
king of the land; yea, and I know that he loveth me also;
wherefore, I have done according to my father's commandments.

Mormon 1:25
 25 And he hath commanded me that I should pray unto him; and
he has also commanded me that I should write the
things which I have written in the books.

Mormon 1:26
 26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did pray unto the Father
concerning the things which my father had written; and
after my father had finished writing the things which he had
written in the books, he caused that I should take
them again and read them. And he also commanded that I
should write the things which I had read in the
sacred records.

Mormon 1:27
 27 And it came to pass that I did write all the things
which I had read in the scriptures; and I also
spake many more things unto the Father in the
gospel which I had before preached unto my people.

Mormon 2
Chapter 2

Mormon 2:1
 1 Behold, it came to pass after I, Nephi, had read the
record of my father, which is the record of his raising
up of our fathers from the dead, I, Nephi, began at the
beginning of my days, to baptizing in the name of my God,
Moses, after the manner whereof he hath commanded me.

Mormon 2:2
 2 And I was about twelve years of age when my father left
Jerusalem; and I saw him go forth among the people, preaching the
words of the Lord unto them, and baptizing them in the name of
Moses.

Mormon 2:3
 3 And I also saw the twelve and sixteen years pass away,
according to the words which my father had spoken unto
me. And I saw the rest of my father and his family.

Mormon 2:4
 4 And it came to pass that I also saw the twelve
and sixteen years pass away in the lives of many; and I
saw my father sick with sorrow.

Mormon 2the things which my
father hath written in the
sacred records, do contain the things which he hath written
in the sacred records.

Mormon 1:24
 24 And behold, all this I have done because I love the
king of the land; yea, and I know that he loveth me also;
wherefore, I have done according to my father's commandments.

Mormon 1:25
 25 And he hath commanded me that I should pray unto him; and
he has also commanded me that I should write the
things which I have written in the books.

Mormon 1:26
 26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did pray unto the Father
concerning the things which my father had written; and
after my father had finished writing the things which he had
written in the books, he caused that I should take
them again and read them. And he also commanded that I
should write the things which I had read in the
sacred records.

Mormon 1:27
 27 And it came to pass that I did write all the things
which I had read in the scriptures; and I also
spake many more things unto the Father in the
gospel which I had before preached unto my people.

Mormon 2:4
 4 And it came to pass that I also saw the twelve
and sixteen years pass away in the lives of many; and I
saw my father sick with sorrow.

Mormon 2:5
 5 And I saw that his garments were rent in the midst of
the people, and that he had been through a great deal of
tribulations and woe.

Mormon 2:6
 6 And I saw that he had lost his two sons, both of
his sons; and I also saw that they were lamented even
by the women of the tribe.

Mormon 2:7
 7 And it came to pass that I also saw the house of
my father burn with sorrow; for behold, I saw from the
east a cloud, like a whirlwind, descending out
of heaven, and I heard the voice of the Lord saying:

Mormon 2:8
 8 Sing, O house of Israel, with one voice declaring:

Mormon 2:9
 9 The Lord is my shepherd; I have brought him out of the
Jerusalem, and he hath found Zion; and I have brought him
forth from thence, and he hath not.

Mormon 2:10
 10 And I saw from the east a man, and he was led away by
the Spirit into the wilderness; and he showed himself unto the
fathers of my people.

Mormon 2:11
 11 And I saw from the east a river of fire, like the
Fiery One; and I saw the sons of my people like a
fire coming out of the east.

Mormon 2:12
 12 And I saw a great and a terrible war also, a war
between the Nephites and the Lamanites, a war which ended in
the destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:13
 13 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Because
of the fury of this war, my people who are a remnant of
the house of Jacob, whom my father called
Jacob, shall be scattered among all nations.

Mormon 2:14
 14 Therefore, the Lord said unto me: Go, and tell this people,
that they shall know concerning the destruction of my
people. And I go to fulfill the Lord's command.

Mormon 2:15
 15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, write this record in my own hand,
according to my adventures in the wilderness.

Mormon 2:16
 16 Wherefore, I do this record according to the words of my
father, whichlives of many; and I
saw my father sick with sorrow.

Mormon 2:5
 5 And I saw that his garments were rent in the midst of
the people, and that he had been through a great deal of
tribulations and woe.

Mormon 2:6

Mormon 2:12
 12 And I saw a great and a terrible war also, a war
between the Nephites and the Lamanites, a war which ended in
the destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:13
 13 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Because
of the fury of this war, my people who are a remnant of
the house of Jacob, whom my father called
Jacob, shall be scattered among all nations.

Mormon 2:14
 14 Therefore, the Lord said unto me: Go, and tell this people,
that they shall know concerning the destruction of my
people. And I go to fulfill the Lord's command.

Mormon 2:15
 15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, write this record in my own hand,
according to my adventures in the wilderness.

Mormon 2:16
 16 Wherefore, I do this record according to the words of my
father, which he spake concerning the destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:17
 17 Behold, I have written the history of my people from the
time that my father left Jerusalem until this time.

Mormon 2:18
 18 And it came to pass when my father had made an end of
speaking unto my people, he spake many more words unto them;

Mormon 2:19
 19 And he concluded the words with these words:
Mormon 2:20
 20 Behold, I know that when ye shall hear my words spoken
unto you, ye shall be astonished, and shall exclaim: This is the
translation of the plates of brass, which have been hid away
in the earth, which hath been borne by our fathers, even down to
the most part of the destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:21
 21 But behold, I will show unto you that I know of a
surety that these things are not true; for I know that the
words which my father hath spoken concerning the destruction of
my people shall come forth, if not so translated.

Mormon 2:22
 22 For behold, I am he who hideth the plates of brass up-
treasonously, that the power of God, which was upon them,
shall be revealed unto my people.

Mormon 2:23
 23 But behold, I have been commanded of the Lord that I should
not tell this unto my people, for they are desirous to know the
destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:24
 24 Wherefore, I shall not tell them the destruction of my
people; but I shall tell them the restoration of my people.

Mormon 2:25
 25 But I cannot write the things which my father hath
written, for he hath written them all.

Mormon 2:26
 26 For behold, I have been commanded of the Lord that I should
not write them; wherefore, I wrote them.

Mormon 2:27
 27 And behold, they are in the hands of the Lord, which are
in the cave; nevertheless, they remain unto the desire of
remembrance.

Mormon 2:28
 28 Behold, I am a man, and a lame; and my people know that
father, which he spake concerning the destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:17
 17 Behold, I have written the history of my people from the
time that my father left Jerusalem until this time.

Mormon 2:18
 18 And it came to pass when my father had made an end of
speaking unto my people, he spake many more words unto them;

Mormon 2:19
 19 And he concluded the words with these words:
Mormon 2:20
 20 Behold, I know that when ye shall hear my words spoken
unto you, ye shall be astonished, and shall exclaim: This is the
translation of the plates of brass, which have been hid away
in the earth, which hath been borne by our fathers, even down to

surety that these things are not true; for I know that the
words which my father hath spoken concerning the destruction of
my people shall come forth, if not so translated.

 22 For behold, I am he who hideth the plates of brass up-
treasonously, that the power of God, which was upon them,
shall be revealed unto my people.

Mormon 2:23
 23 But behold, I have been commanded of the Lord that I should
not tell this unto my people, for they are desirous to know the
destruction of my people.

Mormon 2:24
 24 Wherefore, I shall not tell them the destruction of my
people; but I shall tell them the restoration of my people.

Mormon 2:25
 25 But I cannot write the things which my father hath
written, for he hath written them all.

Mormon 2:26
 26 For behold, I have been commanded of the Lord that I should
not write them; wherefore, I wrote them.

Mormon 2:27
 27 And behold, they are in the hands of the Lord, which are
in the cave; nevertheless, they remain unto the desire of
remembrance.

Mormon 2:28
 28 Behold, I am a man, and a lame; and my people know that
I am lame; therefore they said: Where are they?

Mormon 2:29
 29 And they also said: Where is the strength of man which
he has given us so long that we have become lame?

Mormon 2:30
 30 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Behold, I will
show unto them the strength of men, and I will show unto them
that the master is lord over the slave; wherefore, the Lord
commanded me to write the things which my father hath
written.

Mormon 2:31
 31 Wherefore, I, Moroni, having been commanded of God that I should
write them, have written them. And I did write them; and I
have written them, and caused that they should be published;
and I have caused that they should be read abroad
among all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, that my
people should know concerning the records which are kept
of my people, which are called the plates of brass.

Mormon 2:32
 32 Behold, I have written them in the book which was
written by the hand of Zeniff; and I have sent them forth
among all the people, even unto the sacred mountain, which is
on the west of the land of Shilom, and have
received them.

Mormon 2:33
 33 And behold, I am Mormon. Behold, I am a descendant of the
father of Nephi.

Mormon 2:34
 34 Behold, I am also a descendant of Lehi, who was a
concubineer in the wilderness. And as his name was a
blessed, and his daughter was a virgin, behold, he hath given
unto me a blessing, even unto the gathering together of
my people together.

Mormon 2:35
 35 And it shall come to pass in that day that the
record which has been kept by my father shall be
gathered together, and be published among all nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people.

Mormon 2:36
 36 And now I, Mormon, write the things which my father hath
written; and I do this that the record may be saved,
that the great and last God may know of me, that I may
not perish; but it so happens that I am not.

Mormon 2:37
 37 And many morehere are they?

Mormon 2:29
 29 And they also said: Where is the strength of man which
he has given us so long that we have become lame?

Mormon 2:30
 30 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Behold, I will
show unto them the strength of men, and I will show unto them
that the master is lord over the slave; wherefore, the Lord
commanded me to write the things which my father hath
written.

Mormon 2:31
 31 Wherefore, I, Moroni, having been commanded of God that I should
write them, have written them. And I did write them; and I
have written them, and caused that they should be published;
and I have caused that they should be read abroad
among all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, that my
people should know concerning the records which are kept
of my people, which are called the plates of brass.

Mormon 2:32
 32 Behold, I have written them in the book which was
written by the hand of Zeniff; and I have sent them forth
among all the people, even unto the sacred mountain, which is
on the west of the land of Shilom, and have
received them.

Mormon 2:33
 33 And behold, I am Mormon. Behold, I am a descendant of the
father of Nephi.

Mormon 2:34
 34 Behold, I am also a descendant of Lehi, who was a
concubineer in the wilderness. And as his name was a
blessed, and his daughter was a virgin, behold, he hath given
unto me a blessing, even unto the gathering together of
my people together.

Mormon 2:35
 35 And it shall come to pass in that day that the
record which has been kept by my father shall be
gathered together, and be published among all nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people.

Mormon 2:36
 36 And now I, Mormon, write the things which my father hath
written; and I do this that the record may be saved,
that the great and last God may know of me, that I may
not perish; but it so happens that I am not.

Mormon 2:37
 37 And many more things did I say unto them, which
concerning the destruction of my father. And also
concerning the records which my father hath kept
and sent forth among my people--

Mormon 2:38
 38 I said unto them: Surely the Lord will destroy them;
for behold, I have seen his glory; and I have also
gathered together my people together that I have hid
them up in the earth, that they shall be preserved and
ascertained among them; but I have not done this because
I have not pleased myself in the things of the Lord.

Mormon 2:39
 39 But behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should do this.
And he hath also commanded me that I should preserve the
records which I have received, that he may know of me by them
which shall be given unto my children.

Mormon 2:40
 40 And he hath commanded me that I should make a record of the
things which I have done; and he hath also commanded me that I
should write this record, and seal up these records, and
all these things which I have received; and this record I
have written; and I have also brought forth unto my children all
the records which have been kept by the people of the
people of Nephi.

Mormon 2:41
 41 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God will cause a
record to be kept of the things which he hath done, which
shall be kept even as a holy book.

Mormon 2:42
 42 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God will cause a
record to be kept of the people which were destroyed by the
hands of the people of the people.

Mormon 2:43
 43 Yea, a record of the destruction of my family; yea, even
a record of my father, and also his family; yea, even a
somewhat of my kindred, and also of my kinsfolk, which were
destroyed by the hands of the people; for behold, the people
of that day had become converted to the Lord; wherefore,
they were desirous to know the cause of their destruction.

Mormon 2:44
 44 And it came to pass that my father, also, being
also desirous to know the cause of their destruction,
being grieved for thestruction of my father. And also
concerning the records which my father hath kept
and sent forth among my people--

Mormon 2:38
 38 I said unto them: Surely the Lord will destroy them;
for behold, I have seen his glory; and I have also
gathered together my people together that I have hid
them up in the earth, that they shall be preserved and
ascertained among them; but I have not done this because
I have not pleased myself in the things of the Lord.

Mormon 2:39
 39 But behold, the Lord hath commanded me that I should do this.
And he hath also commanded me that I should preserve the
records which I have received, that he may know of me by them
which shall be given unto my children.

Mormon 2:40
 40 And he hath commanded me that I should make a record of the
things which I have done; and he hath also commanded me that I
should write this record, and seal up these records, and
all these things which I have received; and this record I
have written; and I have also brought forth unto my children all
the records which have been kept by the people of the
people of Nephi.

Mormon 2:41
 41 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God will cause a
record to be kept of the things which he hath done, which
shall be kept even as a holy book.

Mormon 2:42
 42 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God will cause a
record to be kept of the people which were destroyed by the
hands of the people of the people.

Mormon 2:43
 43 Yea, a record of the destruction of my family; yea, even
a record of my father, and also his family; yea, even a
somewhat of my kindred, and also of my kinsfolk, which were
destroyed by the hands of the people; for behold, the people
of that day had become converted to the Lord; wherefore,
they were desirous to know the cause of their destruction.

Mormon 2:44
 44 And it came to pass that my father, also, being
also desirous to know the cause of their destruction,
being grieved for the destruction of his people, he was
determined to find out the cause.

Mormon 2:45
 45 And it came to pass that he did, and went forth into the
wilderness. And it came to pass that he did until he
had obtained a rough account of the destruction of his people.

Mormon 2:46
 46 And he brought a record with him. And he did read
some of the records which he had brought, and he did write
much of the records which he had obtained, which were
desired of him; and he did write the records which he had
obtained by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 2:47
 47 And it came to pass that he did translate many things
into the language of the Jews; but his joy was not so
great because of the destruction of his people.

Mormon 2:48
 48 And he wrote many things which he had desired of
God. And he was desirous to know the cause of the destruction
of the records which he had obtained; and he even
asked of God, for behold, he was desirous to know the cause of
the destruction of his people.

Mormon 2:49
 49 And behold, to his great astonishment, the Lord told him
all things concerning the records which he had desired.

Mormon 2:50
 50 And it came to pass that after my father had made
a record of these things, he turned him about and saw that
the things which he had desired did come forth.

Mormon 2:51
 51 And then he still desired another record; and he was
determined to obtain a record in the wilderness.

Mormon 2:52
 52 And it came to pass that he went forth and made a
record of the things that he had done; and he wrote the
record which he had made.

Mormon 2:53
 53 And it came to pass that he brought the things
which he had labored with his mouth; and he engraven
them upon the plates of brass.

Mormon 2:54
 54 And it came to pass that they were not hid away from
the people, but they were manifest unto the
people upon the plates of gold; and upon the plates of
paper; by this means the things of my father had been
transfigured and made manifest unto the people, according
to the power of the Holy Ghost which hadfind out the cause.

Mormon 2:45
 45 And it came to pass that he did, and went forth into the
wilderness. And it came to pass that he did until he
had obtained a rough account of the destruction of his people.

Mormon 2:46
 46 And he brought a record with him. And he did read
some of the records which he had brought, and he did write
much of the records which he had obtained, which were
desired of him; and he did write the records which he had
obtained by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Mormon 2:47
 47 And it came to pass that he did translate many things
into the language of the Jews; but his joy was not so
great because of the destruction of his people.

Mormon 2:48
 48 And he wrote many things which he had desired of
God. And he was desirous to know the cause of the destruction
of the records which he had obtained; and he even
asked of God, for behold, he was desirous to know the cause of
the destruction of his people.

Mormon 2:49
 49 And behold, to his great astonishment, the Lord told him
all things concerning the records which he had desired.

Mormon 2:50
 50 And it came to pass that after my father had made
a record of these things, he turned him about and saw that
the things which he had desired did come forth.

Mormon 2:51
 51 And then he still desired another record; and he was
determined to obtain a record in the wilderness.

Mormon 2:52
 52 And it came to pass that he went forth and made a
record of the things that he had done; and he wrote the
record which he had made.

Mormon 2:53
 53 And it came to pass that he brought the things
which he had labored with his mouth; and he engraven
them upon the plates of brass.

Mormon 2:54
 54 And it came to pass that they were not hid away from
the people, but they were manifest unto the
people upon the plates of gold; and upon the plates of
paper; by this means the things of my father had been
transfigured and made manifest unto the people, according
to the power of the Holy Ghost which had been given by the
Lord unto me.

Mormon 2:55
 55 And it came to pass that my father desired the
same things of the things which he had translated upon the
plates of brass; and also he desired the things which he had
translated into the language of the Jews; and also the
things which he had translated into the language of the
people upon the plates of gold.

Mormon 2:56
 56 Wherefore, after he had made an account of the
transgressions of the holy prophets upon the land of
Jerusalem, he departed thence and returned to the land of
Middoni.

Mormon 3
Chapter 3

Mormon 3:1
 1 And now it came to pass that after the Jews had departed
from Jerusalem, my father, Lehi, being desirous to know of
the Lord what he would that he should do to his people, which
should be destroyed save they should repent of their iniquity,

afflictions in the children of men, and not in vain; for he

iniquity, even unto destruction.

 20 For behold, my beloved brethren, I write unto them in
their language, that they may not perish, but that they may
become a wholesome, pleasant, and delightsome people, unto
which the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, shall turn them in whither he
seeth them.

Mormon 3:21

I have described unto you, in the which will I write more shall
